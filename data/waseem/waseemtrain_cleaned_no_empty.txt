i love how the islamofascists recruit and year old jihadis and then talk about minors in reference to year olds
a criminal to isis is anyone that does not agree with their barbaric and inhuman religion
nothing desperate about it humanity realizes now that islam declared war on it years ago and islam will be destroyed
idiots like you making such declarations have no contact with reality islam is inhuman and must be outlawed
maybe you can give a talk about how the year old mohammed raped the year old aisha
when an islamolunatic blows himself up in baghdad it has zero to do with bush and blair
israel is only trying to defend itself against murderous muslims trying to wipe it out un votes by muslim nations mean nothing
the muslims have exterminated christians and jews all over the me and continue today where are the un resolutions
muslims are fighting with every religion and none religion on the face of the earth but we are suppose to believe it's jews fault
it seems that allah sits around all day obsessing about women's hands and faces showing i guess idiots need a god on their level
in islam women must be locked in their houses and muslims claim this is treating them well
islam considers women as one big sex organ so no part of her can be exposed this is a reflection of the perversion of their prophet
to muslims a woman walking down the street is a giant vagina demanding to be raped if she is not covered by a tent
the myth of moderate islamic rebels they are all fanatics and must be outlawed
i've been called an islamophobe for saying islam needs a theological reformation now the head of egypt agrees

imam's who disagree with jihad are attacked by muslims so where are these moderate muslims
following the example of the pedophile prophet mohammed in every detail one isis militant is marrying a year old child in mosul
pc puzzle converting to a religion of peace leading to violence
yes they tried to murder their way to heaven a total idiot would believe in such an allah
for example in medina mohammed said kindly cut off the heads of these jewish men and enslave their women
that is a total lie minorities in muslim lands have been exterminated for years
exactly merkel is defending this and the protesters are called islamophobes for being against it
of course it is the quran approves of both slavery and the rape of female slaves
richard was king he could do what he pleased none of your garbage has any bearing on mohammed being a pedophile
and you can't use the culture excuse because mohammed claimed to be guided by allah and that he was creating a culture
what do customs and rules and history have to do with it marrying a year old and screwing a year old is sick like
tarnishes itself i just point out the truth of what is there and you try to rationalize it because you are ashamed
if god is protecting his islam why does he need you to protect it murder apostates and spread his vile religion by sword
and the truth is that more muslims are walking away from islam than people are converting to it education will now kill
the people who disagreed with at the time of the pedophile prophet were murdered by him it's in the hadiths
who knows if they criticized him he killed them and the things against him would never make it into the sunnah
when people leave islam they don't announce it they just quietly walk away
the only reason the overall numbers increase is because muslims breed like rats just like their prophet told them to do
and muslims are expected to fear god as well if living in fear is your idea of perfect you are stupid
because they breed like rats kill non muslims and force religion on people by the sword
yes might power and imperialism is what it is all about there is zero spirituality in it soon the world will understand
no you know damn well that mohammed told his followers to breed as a source of population imperialism
as a percentage there are very few and they are usually poor women who marry a muslim man there is nothing persuasive in islam
only an idiot would think that god wants to be feared muslims cannot think beyond the characteristics of an earthly tyrant
again your entire concept of god corresponds to a tyrannical earthly egomaniac because you are simple and stupid
again you miss the point that god is not interested in military rule phony frauds like mohammed who benefit from it are
exactly is a cult of death centered around the idea of going to a heaven that is described to be a giant whore house
keep repeating and believing your brain dead fairy tales - and follow your prophets medical advice

the problem is that the cathedral doesn't understand that he prophet mohammed declared war on all humanity years ago
here is how inscribes the inferiority and abuse of women
isis follows what is in the quran and the hadiths and sharia exactly to the letter
exactly read the quran and the hadiths and find out for yourself how hateful bigoted sexist vile and inhuman is
there is no personal relationship with creator in islam everything comes through a phony prophet and the only relationship is fear
you are lying what does isis do that the prophet mohammed did not do there are over islamic terrorist groups
the command to fear allah is all through the quran the ritual of groveling on the ground is one of fear no personal relationship
do you grovel on the ground and fear other people that you have a personal relationship with
israeli spat upon beaten by muslims singing anti-semitic songs in berlin

the only thing that stopped muslim slaughter in historical past was military defeat
the reason why i have not been murdered is because i will kill any muslim why tries
and most muslims are actually better behaved than their religion leads them to be
there is no moderate islam islam is is islam no difference
and every muslim is a slave of allah the more religious or islamic the more damage and danger there is
i like that picture of israel in the context of the muslim world a tiny spec they blame for all their own evil

who is justifying christianity microbrain i don't have a religion why are you hiding islamic barbarity
mostly old testament were its heroes attacked and slaughter every man woman child animal
look at all the land occupation in green of islamic domination we are being duped
because islam has over operating terrorist groups and a mandate to conquer the world by violence
again look at this chart and tell me were you get the a few idea
islam has exterminated all kinds of minorities in the me saudi used to be full of minorities
turkey and egypt used to be mostly christian and the muslims have mostly exterminated them
now you see isis following the quran and hadiths and prophet exactly in their genocide
why are you flapping your lips none of this is related to the barbarity of islam
most stupid comment hitler wasn't religious that's a muslim lie truth is hitler admired muslims
that pleased hitler grand mufti provided hitler w armies of muslim soldiers from europe
it's called execution or conversion at sword point you're welcome
no the quotes mean exactly what they say but most people are naturally less hateful than islam
inciting hatred is central to islam in order to promote imperialism
just because i have no religion does't mean that i don't want to stop islam from murdering
you don't need a perverted religion to feel compassion for humanity
look at the size of israel and yet muslims are slavering to destroy it
jews used to live on of the arabian penninsula muslims have virtually exterminated them
the hadith about the arabian penninsula is why muslims will not rest till they destroy israel
that hadith is specific to ap many others are specific to war on non believers everywhere
million africans murdered by islam
yes it's murder for a fraudulent god if every religion used your excuse mankind would be dead
you don't guarantee them protection you guarantee them third class citizenship and extortion
we don't want to teach you we want to stop your taquiyya lying about it
thanks for admitting that you are murderers and check your map
actually it's islam that has to be destroyed for it's crimes against humanity
your prophet started exterminating jews from the very beginning like the destruction of khybar
your text is a fraud brought by a pedophile slave trader rapist murderer bigot sexist robber
the idiots don't understand that the prophet of islam declared war on all humanity years ago
the real piss drinkers are the muslims here is the proof
i guess if you call murder rape slavery hatred bigotry and sexism beautiful then it is beautiful
only because there were too many hindus to exterminate before the british
before the british showed up the muslims murdered million hindus
and today there is still not peace between them because of the muslims
the only reason there is peace is because the hindus are in power
next door in pakistan the muslims still murder christians and hindus regularly
they claim oh you insulted our religion and kill them
really what are they doing that your prophet did not also do
muslims are fighting jews hindus buddhists christians atheists and animists somewhere in the world
islam has bloody borders everywhere and cannot get along with anyone
really muslims understand this they just want to be able to use the name to shut us up racism
we could deal with the violent fanatics if the texts of islam weren't producing more
children grow out of their fairy tales muslims never grow out of theirs
all of the land the muslims have they colonialized
there's a huge lie they colonialized everything they have at sword point
i guess it's time for you to learn about in islam racism
people who call being against islam racist know that islam is not race but want to intimidate others into shutting up
the prophet mohammed was a terrorist and he knew islam
islam is for liars

muslim terrorists murder people in paris terrorist attacks since it's not an aberration it's the real
muslims are not a race idiot they are a cult of murder and terrorism
why is it that no other religions have statistics that are even close in the production of terrorism
islam is a cult of murder that declared war on all of humanity years ago here is proof
bad logic if all muslims did what their books of hatred and murder tell them they would all be dead
for the last years islam has contributed nothing to mankind but murder
since of all believes that people who leave the religion should be murdered where are the moderate muslims
notice muslims want sharia and sharia says that apostates must be killed but only support that directly
notice how the news media avoids pointing out that the murderers of the french are followers of the death cult of
the us attacks terrorists and dictators your religion opposes freedom and democracy
okay we understand that you and your religion are terrorists don't me any more
children in pakistan journalists in paris shoppers in australia ezidis in iraq it all comes from the death cult of
not gunmen muslim terrorists
your sadness is exactly what the terrorists want
you are a liar trying to shut people up using the term islam is not a race and you know it it is a
having more children is what their prophet mohammed told them to do reproductive imperialism
how can they be sound when of them think people leaving islam should be murdered
a small percentage the majority are radicals
when does freedom of speech not insult someone why should a hate filled religion be excluded
but there are many ideologies and islam declared war on the human race years ago
'charlie hebdo' editor killed in paris terror attack built career on defiance
will any of the media talking heads ever broach the subject that is incompatible with free speech and democracy are they pc cowards

pacificim is no solution the hindus tried that and the muslims slaughter them for years
until we fight the war on islam in earnest we will never know where it gets us
you say islam is a religion i say it is a cult islam's activities match the description of crime mafia you must bust it
of the religion is ready to murder apostates there are no moderate muslims
no islam declared war on all humanity years ago
in the wake of the it pisses me off to hear politicians celebrities amp the like trying to lessen islam's role
islam according to ex-muslim not me this guy pakistaniguydonthugmemysuicidejacketmigh tgooff and i think t http
the prophet mohammed also had people murdered that spoke against him
what you said was incoherent but here is the proof that islam declared war on all humanity
nobody cares what his honor means to you fools we have no obligation to honor the slave trader and caravan robber
we could care less how much you love the fraud we have the right to think of him any way we want and express that
already did found out that islam is a vile bigoted hateful murdering sexist slavery supporting cult
when religious war jihad is a cornerstone of the religion there is no possibility for reform
political satire always pisses off someone why should the religion of hatred and murder be excluded
we need to outlaw islam outright
you are talking bullshit the information is clear that the majority of muslims are not moderate
again you talk like an idiot i have no religion and what you say changes nothing about muslims being extremists
editorial murderous soul of radical islam has attacked the foundation of western civilization http
the woman wearing the bikini can wear it or she can cover everything her choice if she makes that choice in islam she is beaten
that is one of the pieces of lying propaganda that muslims try to fool westerners with here is story
france is on the verge of major cultural backlash against even moderate islam the tension has built for decades the line has
take a poll and see if of christians think gays should be killed if they do christianity should be banned
if you like it or not islam declared war on all humanity in the quran years ago
like all such writers they blab on endlessly as experts without ever having read the quran or hadiths
same msm that insists islam has no connection w terror censors cartoons cuz they fear being murdered s
all religions are not the same islam is more violent than other religions
it's unbelievable the way that journalists fall all over themselves to make excuses for the barbarity of islam not one has read the quran
yes according to islam muslims are encouraged to kill you i'm not a muslim and i have no issues with hindus
yes the quran tells muslims to murder people of other religions
according to your own canon your prophet is a pedophile murderer rapist caravan robber slave trader sexist and bigot
twisted logic in the world of islam
islam cannot forbid anything it is a sick cult with no power under the law
i read the entire quran islam is what is wrong
a he wasn't a prophet b there has been no peace for years
what does isis do that the prophet mohammed did not also do
this is a more complete picture of the bigotry of islam than your selective lie
karen armstrong was interested in writing a hero worship book that would sell with muslims very narrow picture
i don't care it's none of mohammed's business what religion someone wants to be
you choose your religion and islam is clearly barbaric and inhuman it has zero to do with god
one must imagine god being insulted by having such a hateful war mongering decisive bigoted sexist religion calling him
the muslims relationship to god is fear he is told to fear allah again and again in the quran
why does it not occur to you that only an idiot would imagine a god who wants to be feared
i don't follow any god but if one were to imagine satan inventing a religion it would be like islam
did your prophet behead people like isis - yes did he enslave people like isis - yes did he murder people like isis - yes
did your prophet rape slaves like isis - yes did your prophet tell women to cover up and stay home like isis - yes
looks to me like baghdadi is a carbon copy of mohammed without the prophecies
the idea about all of these moderate muslims is oversold most are extremists
nobody cares the law protects women mohammed's phony laws abuse women
what is mainstream about him forgetting murdered christians closed universities murdered doctors women locked at home
mainstream muslims are also radicals
that's like saying that my freedom is limited if i'm not allowed to kill you
a muslim's religious freedom involves denying others their freedom so islam must be outlawed
i don't really care what some muslims practice i care that islam encourages murder hatred sexism
obviously the driving meme of islam is world domination if it be by force intimidation or persuasion
muhammad was the inventor of thighing he started molesting aisha when she was years old cc
stop threatening people to get them to do what you want that's why people hate religion
manipulative and threatening bs proving that people have to be intimidated into following the god of terror
people fill the void and emptiness with all kinds of imaginary nonsense including allah
what are you crying about microbrain islam declared war on all humanity years ago
in know more about the religion than you and it is pure evil
why do you complain islam has been ethnic cleansing everybody for years isn't it time to return the favor
not only dead daesh but baghdadi ran like a coward will he behead himself for fleeing like he does his men gwer
good reason not to practice a religion that declared war on all humanity years ago
doctrine supports terrorism amp violence
i hope so because in english it comes off as moronic hate mongering
now if we can only get the world to recognize that islam declared war on humanity ago and outlaw it
why should you be annoyed at being denied rights that you don't give to others you are a hypocrite
dumb muslims complain about freedom of speech and support blasphemy laws at the same time what a disgusting inhuman religion
you are a muslim you are brain dead you repeat what others have said a million times
now if hollande and other leaders will only understand that the islam of the quran is radical islam outlaw islam
if you search objectively you will find that the pedophile prophet mohammed declared war on all humanity years ago
why do these so called moderate muslims never ask themselves why islam has over terrorist groups and no other religion is remotely close
islam is a religion of hate violence and deceit
until people like hollande acknowledge that teaches murder and hatred we will always be dealing with the symptoms not the problem
but it is a lie the religion is a disgusting terrorist hate mongering piece of filth that has nothing to do with individuals
islam and muslims shame islam
no they showed you the good face of people there is no good face of islam
he incited car attacks amp praised synagogue murderers as martyrs now mahmoud abbas visits paris to condemn terror http
you didn't recognize the irony of me using your method because you are an ignorant muslim
by now no one buys that few individuals lie any more most muslims are extremists
allah's words are filth and hatred and phony
lost glory of islam whats that am not aware of any glory any grt contribution frm them to the world
that old lie again muslims repeat the same lie again and again here is the truth about it
i choose to define it by the quran and it's followers and most are extremists
a piece at a time start by outlawing new mosques and stoping muslim immigration
then export all the non citizen imams put cameras in the remaining mosques
then jail any imam that teaches any aspect of jihad or sexism etc
how many times do i have to tell you that most muslims are extremists
of course because radical islam by definition under sharia means going back in time its uncivilized
dens of apostates murder for the sake of religion could you get any more stupid and inhuman
you and your religious brothers are the real filth of the earth pkk rescued yezidis from your animal friends
islam declared war on all humanity years ago and this piece of dog manure oktar is talking about others intimidation
until we get beyond making excuses for just a few bad muslims and recognize islam as a religion of terror paris will keep happening
it's not about satire or free speech pretending it is will solve nothing the problem is that the quran is full of incitement for murder
as long as we make feel good lectures and demonstrations about freedom of speech we are avoiding the real problem - the violence of islam
our politicians make inane speeches about freedom of speech while studiously avoiding the real source of the problem the violence in
we would be much better off figuring out what to do about islamofascim than ranting about freedom of speech or who went to paris
the prophet mohammed also had people murdered for criticizing him so the paris murders were very much a part of the real
the reason these politically correct idiots will never solve problem is because they won't acknowledge that it's islam
this is the big lie about it doesn't advocate tolerance and coexistence it advocates hatred and murder
stupid comment isis is sponsored by islam and they behave exactly like the terrorist prophet mohammed
so when the subject of islam's relationship with terrorism comes up they react like the empty morons they are
salon tries to shut down free speech and shut people up by playing a race card about an ideaology
first off the cretins at salon are unaware that there is nothing that isis does that mohammed did not also do
do you think that the brick heads at salon know that the prophet mohammed beheaded people in mass
do you think the yokels at salon know that mohammed was a slave trader who owned slaves not a chance
do the bb brains at salon understand that the rape of slave girls was approved and practiced by mohammed
do the trolls at salon know that the prophet mohammed was a caravan robber they don't
objecting to this is what the pc zombies at salon call racism
objecting to this is what the pc morons of salon call racism
objecting to this is what the pc morons of salon call racism
objecting to this is what the pc morons of salon call racism
do you think that the cretins at salon understand mohammed's declaration of war on humanity no
do you think that the mindless little bozos at salon understand that quran is full of bigotry
any chance that salon understands what most muslims think about some very primitive ideas no
the terrorists themselves trumpet their allegiance to allah and their religion it's stupid to pretend away
claiming that islam is not a problem because states that are islamic repress their citizens is a contradiction of ideas
islam tells us that we must accept sexism so i guess muslim sexism must be accepted or you are racist
okay and what are you going to make the other islamic terrorists groups equivalent to
name the last person the kkk killed and you can find that have since been killed by islamists
another guilt feeling fool islam attacked and conquered of christianity before crusades
the first crusades were muslims invading spain and france - years before european crusades
why would you profile white people blacks murder at times the rate as whites
islam declared war on all humanity years ago and nothing has changed
i don't think so but we do need to outlaw islam
there have been islamic terrorist attacks since
the department of justice report says blacks kill at times the rate of whites
the hindus tried a pacifist approach to islam the muslims responded by murdering million
so are people who support murder for apostacy guilty of anything
what do you think we are doing when we accept muslim immigrants what do we get back
muslims are not a race they are a murder cult
there are over islamic terrorist groups no other religion is close
it's utterly stupid to tolerate the intolerance of islam
and yet it is a law of islam and of muslims support that law but you tell me to tolerate em
so you want to be tolerant of islam and intolerant of religions
the quran spend of it's space hating on unbelievers that's hard to put aside
i have no religion but i can accommodate jews hindus christians buddhists taoist atheists but islam is too cancerous
tell it to the islamofascists
that's an excuse and a cop out every single islamic nation is repressive they produce either dictators or theocrats
you are basically claiming that a religion that teaches hatred and murder has nothing to do with hatred and murder dumb
she is crying boohoo you are terrorizing our islamic terrorists
why is isis obsessed with beheadings because their terrorist prophet mohammed had men beheaded in one day
this is debate about the vile religion of islam not about one country microbrain
nobody said anything about jews racist we are talking about islam and muslims here
you are lying most muslims are still extremists
that is a load of manure it says the same thing in translation as it does in arabic it is still a pile of hatred and
and you get to put an x on the islamic bullshit bingo card
why should the world care when islam declared war on all humanity years ago
do you think that they do it because the prophet mohammed fought for plunder
i agree he is just like the prophet mohammed
a phony prophet trying to gain power through hatred and divisiveness is the reason for it
these are all excuses to hide the fact that you are following an evil and inhuman religion
what is amazing is how often allah's revelations met mohammed desires but no one became suspicious except aisha
and if someone wants to leave islam then islam declares him an apostate and demands that he be murdered
the mess was there long before the us the entire history of islam is murder
and today the huge majority of death in islamic states are done by muslims
for example of all civilians killed in afghanistan are killed by taliban
islam is a good place for criminals to find a home
a religion that declares war on humanity has no respect for anyone and is hypocritical to ask for respect
every muslim who is forced to stay in islam by the law of apostacy for murder is forced
every child that is brainwashed and never given a choice is force
all the christians and ezidis that are told to leave or convert or die are forced
i know that they are forced into islam by being brainwashed and never being given a choice
i know the truth it is million citizens of the earth murdered by scum shouting allahu akbar
and don't talk to me about hatred when you follow the vulgar quran and hadiths that are full of hatred
you have to be an idiot to think that you can follow an ideology of murder imperialism hatred and have people like you for it
i am better i have no problem with hinduism christianity tao judaism buddhism or atheism but islam hates all non-muslims
yes people can believe what they want but islam doesn't give them that choice
and no one is entitled to a belief that denies other people their believes
no i keep giving you proof and you ignore it where is islam's respect go and read the pact of umar
islam is the only religion that has large forces of religious police running around telling people what they must do
even muslims talk about forcing children to become muslims it's not a big secret
this is another clear expression of how islam thinks of women being owned by men
the stupidity of jihadis who think that you only need guns to run a civil society
the idea of going to a country where the female half are treated like slaves and leppers makes my skin crawl
and i would never go near a country with blasphemy laws
the same old lie about property rights but arab women had those before islam
allah the mutilator can you feel the 'peace' yet
islam is about as perfect as nazism
screw francis any pope that will not stand up for freedom of speech should not be pope get rid of the clown
true no other ideology is as vile murderous backwards and stupid as islam
you animals are slitting throats and we are suppose to care that you are offended by cartoons
saudi arabia - a nation of islamolunatics hiding from the islamolunatics they helped to create
gay man thrown off the rooftop by isis for being gay despite what the radical left claims this is the real
that is because islam is stuck in the seventh century
because the muslims are mostly just as crazy
i haven't seen jews go on killing rampage against holocaust deniers violence is islam's answer to everything
same country where conversion away from islam is illegal one way street and a slow wiping out of non-musl
you mean hapless genocidal palestinian islamolunatics that are determined to erase israel from the map
and of course the palestinians are firing rockets at israel without any regard for what they hit including women and children
international press couldn't even tell where the shells came from to hell with murdering islamists including hamas
here is what the scumbag muslims do with children and then they use them for propaganda
here is how muslims treat non muslims so fuck the genocidal palestinians
who manufactures all the rockets that the palestinians fire at israel and who manufactures the terrorists kalishnikovs
here is a map of israel inside all of the muslim nations that want to destroy israel and murder them
you can't get any sicker than the muslim animals following the instructions of their pedophile prophet
yes all of the land the muslims have they got by butchering the inhabitants and they are depraved psychopaths
before the murdering prophet mohammed came along to exterminate them jews lived on of the arabian peninsula
the filthy palestinians have attacked and murdered jewish children in their schools in the past so fuck palestinians
the prophet mohammed was a caravan robber who declared war on all humanity hope the jews recover their stolen land
no one ask for your pedophile serving propaganda swine
so they have to imprison the people of mosul and not allow them to leave islam is a religion of slaves and slavery
crucifixion stoning beheading shooting throwing off buildings - isis is an orgy if sadistic gruesome methods of murder
islamic no go zones are common knowledge except to idiots like you
karen armstrong kisses the criminal mohammed's ass so that she can sell books
lol it is common knowledge and there are countless reports about muslim no go areas in europe just google it
islam has contributed nothing to humanity but hatred death and destruction for a thousand years
mullah oktar is an anti science kurd hating islamolunatic
and by doing so she helped subject the world to years of terrorism
i don't care what they retracted the no go zones are there here is an example
look at the data dipwad think that people who leave islam should be killed
look at the data dipwad want sharia law which denies all rights to women and non muslims
yeah unlike the muslims who are executing gays by throwing them off buildings
you babble like a moron while muslims are throwing gays off buildings
no go zones are exactly acting to impose such microbrain
the prophet mohammed declared war on all non muslims years ago exactly to impose such
the idea that no go zones are a right wing boogie man is stupid no go zones are real
eh they all ostensible follow the ideology of islam radicals follow closely others less so
all muslims share an ideology that is spelled out as bigoted sexist imperialists homophobic
as would i but of course many muslims live under theocracy and where they are minorities they try to creep up to it
that should be true but isis exists to follow the religion exactly
so isis beheads because their prophet beheaded isis rapes slaves because their prophet raped them
but sharia is very sexist and of muslims want it
so are you saying that the quran is wrong with this piece of bigotry
but there are very few of those on the other hand of muslims want barbaric sharia
and your attitude is to let creeping sharia and sexism into muslim areas of the west
no compulsion in religion unless you're a kid of course
nazis were not christians mohammed led major military expeditions jesus led zero
so when are you going to admit that the quran is wrong i'm waiting
the violence is always initiated by the muslims mohammed started it proof
there should be no freedom to impose your religion on others and that is what islam is about
your mantra about a few is stupid this proves it
it's not about any specific individuals but about an ideaology that will always produce terrorists
then suddenly their muslim neighbors are persecuting them and stealing their property
but islam hates free speech
that's only because they don't follow islam islam tells women to stay at home
the sunnah of the prophet is the basis for sharia law along with the quran and the quran is woman hating
women should have the same sexual rights as me but islam says they clearly don't
all you are doing with your verses is proving sexism in islam
again the woman must be obedient to the man even if he is a fool and she is brilliant you are proving my point again
in a lot of muslim countries saying that mohammed is flawed is blasphemy that would get you beaten
you are following the religion of ignorance with an illiterate prophet and you want to talk about spelling lol
isis in mosul executed people for watching soccer game muslims will go crazy about a mohammed cartoon but won't protest murder
sssshhh the silent muslim majority remains quiet
muslims australia to form australian all-muslim army impose sharia law
they will all have no skills except jihad
a simple question ask complaining muslims why etc can integrate amp live h
no they don't they share a commitment to the barbarity of their religion
religion at gunpoint and allegiance at gun point
the shia and sunni are back to killing each other in yemen as they have done everywhere for years the gift of
love it when these idiot national leaders claim that terrorism has nothing to do with islam and not one has read the quran
question is why don't the german criminal prosecutors announce an investigation into islam's incitement to hatred
this guy spouted one lie after another and there is no response in this video just typical lying muslim propaganda
this guy spouted one lie after another and there is no response in this video just typical lying muslim propaganda
muslim bigot wanted by interpol and protected by u s ally wants un to criminalize criticism of islam internationally htt
most muslims instinctively understand that islam cannot survive in light of day and must be protected by blasphemy laws
islam is terror to fight terror you have to fight islam your prophet and your god are both sick terrorists
having read the quran and hadiths i discovered that islam is a murderous bigoted sexist hate mongering cult
professor attacked on campus for telling truth about islam the religion that cannot survive without killing speech
the prophet of islam made his living robbing caravans so of course isis will make money stealing if they can
what the americans did in iraq was allow the iraqis to elect their leadership sunnis and shia killing each other is islam
the problem was not the communists atheism but rather their totalitarianism just like islam
and historians have actually made countless efforts to independently collaborate anything in islam it's totally fabricated
the reason that is newsworthy is because the muslim contribution is so much more often destructive
the difference between the daesh and the fsa is not that big the fsa are also islamolunatics
the next successor to the saudi throne will be the son of a slave girl
mullah oktar is a liar and an islamofanatic he hates the ypg for their secularism so he makes up garbage about them
religion my ass death cult
what is wrong with that considering how the sunni arabs have been exterminating everyone else for years
one of the pedophile prophets big battles was the battle of the trench in medina isis are trying to imitate that trick with a mosul trench
isis mortared kobane killing women and children so you just called isis cowards lol idiot
mohammed hid behind a trench in medina when the meccan army showed up so i guess he was a coward for that also
theresa may today pleaded with not to leave jews build wealth muslims take welfare simple economics
sir winston churchhill islam is a dangerous in a man as rabies in a dog
yeap islam is for ignorant butts
two good books that document the depravity of islam
islam killed it
but islam puts out the light and makes life too dark to bear
choudary tells the truth about islam islam has no spirituality it is only about forcing the world to obey
lol the me was very creative before islam most muslim discoveries came from conquered persians
and those few discoveries were made despite islam not because of it islam has contributed nothing to mankind in years
the prophet mohammed was illiterate superstitions and knew nothing but war theft and slave trading
what's to understand the daesh have passed a law that people cannot leave raqqa or mosul because they are sewers of terror
salahuddin was a general who fought for islamic slavery what does that have to do with kurds fighting for freedom today
no the lies that i tell come directly from the quran and hadiths like declaration of war on humanity
for example muslims claim algebra but the greeks and indians were making good progress on algebra before mohammed was born
the hatred against jews and christians and others was begun by mohammed
what is there to teach we both know that the quran is a cult manual of hatred imperialism murder sexism and bigotry
well since islam is full of hate and divisiveness it does bring thugs who hate to islam
daesh price list for yezidi and christian sex slaves
our poor live far better than the middle class of most muslim countries
sharia - taking injustice to new heights
you must have found it in your imagination because it doesn't exist in islam
you are the one sitting in a black tent holding an ak so don't talk to me about hate
you will see that loss of men and weapons accelerate land loss in the next few months the kurds are on the mosul doorstep
you must be really young and ignorant if you think a few bombing runs are going to cause anyone to miss a meal lol
the people studying islam all have the iq of a camel a ten year old could figure out that this religion is evil by design
they can't read write do math or produce anything but they can kill people so they are good muslims
islam on the other hand fights to take away people's freedom and force them to obey an imaginary terrorist god
hamaz never stopped it's war on israel islam never stopped it's war on humanity
isis intend turn war of islamism into ethnic war of pan arabism amp kurd in mosul as evidence show they are conducting pan ara
no he's not he's an idiot he retweets things like nigger hunting licenses that never existed he's a fraud
not to mention crushing poverty endless violence and legal forced marriage of year old girls
another barbaric aspect of islam is to murder people for the way they were born
could that be because islam declared war on humanity years ago
soon they will have to ask their uneducated moronic madrassa rats to do surgery a butcher knife and a prayer
the jews of europe should just come to the us then the europeans can allow islam to take them backwards
the battles were won because mohammed gave his thugs of what they stole
i think the word you're searching for is
in islam all the facts are also foul
that old line of bs there are over islamic terrorist orgs no other religion is close
is designed to be a crushing of the human spirit with laws that only provide one outlet - the brutalizing of non muslims
like i said that is a stupid comment that seeks to hide the vileness of islam
a typical muslim response is to excuse muslim barbarity by pointing elsewhere
honest and fair is that islam is a religion of hate murder bigotry and sexism
the stupidist arguments are the ones rationalizing the barbarity of islam
the quran was produced by a pedophile slave trader caravan robber murderer
if there was a satan he would have invented islam
you like words they all say islam is vile
if you had a brain it would be revolted by islam
you do understand that mohammed was a sexist
the jews lived on of arabian peninsula before mohammed began genocide
the muslims attacked europe years before crusades microbrain
the logic of a retarded madrassa rat
there is nothing that isis does that the prophet mohammed didn't also do
isis has slavery because the prophet mohammed was a slave owner and trader
isis beheads people because mohammed beheaded jews in one day
isis makes women cover and locks them up because that is what mohammed did
isis practices genocide because the prophet mohammed practiced it
isis wants to control the world because mohammed wanted to control it
i know that the scum mohammed engraved hatred for jews into islam
and muslims never progress they are still barbaric
nothing is more barbaric that the muslims
tell me something that isis does that mohammed did not do
majority of muslims are sexist and bigots
no muslim land has ever lived under anything but tyrants dummy
the term islamophobe makes as much sense as naziophobe
if you don't want to read a pedo you have to stop reading the quran
mohammed was murdering jews before zionism existed
the little girls draw the highest price because of your pedophile prophet
we don't make prophets out of pedophile priests we get rid of them
but at least half of muslims are extremists again
and the quran sanctions raping slave girls
there is nothing that isis does that prophet mohammed did not also do
sharia put the muslim world years behind the rest of civilization and tortured minorities
your prophet used catapults to attack cities murdering women and children so what are you crying about
islam declared war on all mankind years ago now muslims cry like babies when others respond in kind
yahya flips out about pkk being communists but that is clearly no longer true just propaganda
the prophet mohammed was a big murderer he once beheaded jews in one day isis does what he did
but this is a good lesson that you can't win in the st century with ignorant madrassa rats
mohammed was illiterate and superstitious and islam's backwardness is catching up to it's jihadis
and we fought the germans for their actions the first crusades were muslims attacking christiandom
polls show that the majority of muslims are very primitive in their believes
you are pandering to a religion that declared war on all humanity years ago
no muslims follow a religion based on terrorism not jews
muslim declared war on humanity and their have been murdering men women and children for years
my point is that there is nothing that isis does that mohammed did not also do both are sick and disgusting criminals
everyone else does not follow a pedophile prophet who owned slaves robbed caravans and raped women - only muslims
i've spent more time studying and thinking about religion than you've been alive i understand islam perfectly
there is actual spirituality in buddhism and tao there is zero spirituality in islam
earthly tyrants are also egotistical and want everyone to admire them and bow down to them so the quran writer imagined god
the quran writer imagined god as egotistical and as wanting to be worshiped and bowed to because he was unsophisticated
god has zero need of our worship or admiration or obedience it does nothing for god
buddhist teaching does not contain violence hatred or jihad islam does
the problem with islam is that it cannot be fixed and still be islam
the quran itself is the source of the hatred murder imperialism sexism
so the only way the problems of islam can be fixed is to outlaw islam
are not destructive and inhuman by design like islam
jesus didn't murder rape rob go to war or own slaves like mohammed
the difference between judism and islam is no foundation in jihad in judaism
judaism doesn't want to take over the world like islam
can't expect honesty from people who follow a caravan robber
no the hatred was all started by mohammed
a good muslim is good despite his bad religion not because of it
i know about judaism i don't recommend it but most jews are secular
mo expelled two jewish tribes from medina and stole their property the third tribe he beheaded all the men enslaved the rest
later he attacked the jews of khybar killed many stole their property
as a result of muslim hatred there are no jews or christians left in saudi
no that is the excuse mohammed used to rob and murder he states his genocidal intention here
and traitors are individuals not tribes and their women and children you make up lying excuses for barbarity like a muslim
scandinavian people will not be displaced by jews they'll be displaced by muslim
if rape murder pedophelia bigotry war sexism and genocide are just and peaceful the islam is just and peaceful
in other words you were too stupid to understand that your th century barbarity would bring more enemies
more like three thousand and most of it was done by the kurdish girls
and it cost isis half their best fighters the city can be rebuilt - free of the isis animals
countryside will be easy to take mosul and raqqa will be difficult because the daesh will hid behind civilians
daesh threw a major offensive friday to show they were still strong they only managed to show their weakness
buildings are not as valuable as the men you lost even if they were rats
pakistan is a nation of haters killers and savages see this tweet barbarism is in the masses' minds
greece is like a patient in the icu who doesn't want to pay for the meds and hospital stay
why would anyone loan money to greece when they can be certain it will never be paid back
yes they are jew hating barbarians
and you are an obvious liar because you pick the smallest part of the story to tell your lie with
then he attacked and defeated the third medina tribe beheaded all the men and enslaved women and children
then he launched a completely unprovoked attack on the jews of khybar murdered many and stole their land
and periodically the muslims went on rampages and murdered masses of jews this happed all over muslim world
not a single one was left in many gulf states and the process of their extermination continues
so don't feed me your little piece of taqiyya bs
the muslims are out of control and determined to steal the last tiny piece of land left to the jews
yeah let the barbarians have it and hope they come for us last
like every muslim country they find money for weapons but they don't have the money for schools
women from pakistan's christian and hindu minorities are particularly vulnerable to forced marriage to muslim men
and yet our number and quality of schools are luxurious compared to pakistan where don't even have working toilets
compared to the sewer and violence and poverty of muslim pakistan americans live in opulence
you muslims should kiss our ass for buying your oil if we didn't you'd be riding camels and the population of the me would be
and without western invention the muslim oil resources would be nothing but a filthy useless liquid
and i'm not sure how you can yammer about homelessness when muslims are still murdering people for apostacy and blasphemy
looks like the daeshbags are now completely broken and fleeing the kobane area
yes but it smells great now that the daesh rats have run
this is what christians and other non muslims have had to deal with for years in the middle east
our prophet our honor = rape beheadings and genocide our honor = muhammad does not deserve respect
leave it to some microbrain to get sanctimonious by finding a way to play the race card
maybe you should encourage more jewish girls to marry black men to show how you are open minded
i hear all kinds of people say that jews control the agenda and the media
all the rest are impoverished like every muslim country that doesn't have an ocean of oil
a worshipper of the pedophile prophet has no room to call anyone a biggot since islam is a religion of hate and bigotry
obviously you know nothing about your religion permission to rape slave girls is in both quran and hadiths
in islam the only innocent souls are muslims anyone else is fair game for any abuse
i once again want to express my gratitude towards my ancestors for not converting to islam i would have no place to hide in
yes we have heard it a million times islam is not about islam
new chant outside the diwan in no tahawi no zarqawi we want to execute al-rishawi
true stoning and beheading were much more to mohammed's taste
more of the same kind of burning by other muslims
different groups in the me are competing to see who can be the most islamic by being the most barbaric autocratic and inhuman
yes it's a violation of islam because islam demands that he be beheaded rather than burned
the islamic organization isil forcing christian people remaining in mosul to attend sessions for koran conservation
terrorism has been the core of islam ever since the fraudulent prophet mohammed invented it
if we dont ban they'll ban us rt new islamic state video features french cont
our journalists watch isis burn a man in a cage and they respond with the same tired cliche about hijacking the religion bs it's
there is nothing in the quran about forbidding child marriages and mohammed married ashia at the age of
wrong microbrain she was and you like your prophet are a liar here is the proof
debunked what ignorant one you are debunked by this hadith say she was six
and the muslim students hadith database shows ashia was when the pedo mohammed married her
muslims always look to excuse the barbarity of islam by changing the subject
another muslim troll trying to hide the fact that his prophet was a pedophile by changing subject
following example of their prophet muslims are still commonly marrying children no one else is
who cares jews don't marry children muslims do all the time
nothing justifies the existence of any muslim country all muslim land is stolen land
hey idiot you can't use the problems of judaism to justify the barbarity of the quran
furthermore you cannot identify a single verse of the quran that limits the age of marriage of a girl
again a muslim liar trying to change the subject to hide the proven fact that her prophet is a pedophile
i don't give a shit about what the talmud says because jews all live under secular laws not under talmud
but muslims are dying to live under sharia and to bring back all the vileness and barbarity of their prophet
as you can see for yourself pedophelia is illegal in israel but is legal in muslim countries outlaw islam
do you approve of your pedophile prophet raping a year old girl like it says in hadith
your prophet was a low life murdering raping robbing bigoted sexist pedophile
now since you claim that islam limits age of marriage but produce no verses to back up your lies you are blocked
this guy is a muslim who is lying mohammed there are hadith that clearly and explicitly state that aisha was when married
when muslims try to defend their prophet against pedophelia they never tell you about the proof that he was a pedo
the story about her age came from both aisha and ursa it can be found in both bukhari and muslim
dodge rambles on making assertion after assertion with zero evidence and no references in quran or hadith it's garbage
defensive sword roflmao the muslims defended themselves all the way to france and india
what was mohammed defending when he attacked the jews of khybar
funny how defenders of islam like to bring up the crusades but the muslim crusaders were attacking christianity first
obama refuses to recognize that there is no difference between the behavior of the prophet mohammed and isis
obama's peaceful islam islam that no one is allowed to challenge even if it means muslims threatening your life ht
why our president chose to insult christianity and excuse militant islam at the national prayer breakfast
nazism has revisited europe this time in garb of islam wave of antisemitism hits europe
ezra levant - from canadian jihadis to isis it's all islam via
the quran clearly and explicitly declared war on all humanity years ago so humanity must declare war on islam
isis beheads people mohammed beheaded jews in one day
mohammed was a caravan robber isis steals others property
mohammed had people who disagreed with him murdered isis murders the same
mohammed told women to cover up and stay home isis tells women to cover up and stay home
mohammed was an imperialist that led major military expeditions isis is imperialist
when has he ever done anything else
isis practices slavery and rape mohamed practiced slavery and rape
mohammed had a child bride isis marries off children
wrong jewish tribe microbrain the jews of khybar had nothing to do with mohammed
they welcomed islam with a sword at their throats there was nothing kind about islam it was a religion designed for thugs
you claim to be anti religion yet you spend all your time lying for the benefit of islam the religion of hate
let people read the quran and see that it comes from hate
let people look at the polls that muslims answered and see that they come from hate
it's a guide for nothing it's islam's claims of the laws of god and islam's god is a terrorist islam's prophet too
yes you can lie about islam all you want and you can deny all the evidence all you want no one cares about opinion
you can blab endlessly about love but you defend a religion of hate - which is the action of a hater namely you
mohammed's excuse in every aggression is i had to attack because i heard they were going to attack
and today many muslims are still worthless thugs that produce nothing they are either rescued by oil money or try to steal
even your own link shows that the jews were the producers and the muslims lived by stealing others property
then when there was no one left to rob the muslims returned to being dessert bedouins still trying to rob each other
of all inventions come from the west islam has produced nothing in years mohammed was an illiterate who produced nada
the few things islam came up with were from conquered people and came in spite of islam not because of it
the me led the world in development before there was islam and fell behind the world after islam
and the muslims robbed the wealthy merchants
now you are babbling like every muslim conspiracy idiot cia created isis utterly stupid and without evidence you are blocked
sometimes you have to go to the hadiths to clarify the quran
if that is allah's wish then why doesn't the lazy asshole do it himself
let me guess you've got no friends and no career either that or you are a psychopath
this is an isis humanitarian concern it's a terrible thing to do to isis now they can't rape her any more
must be hard on isis now they can't rape her anymore or make a propaganda film of her execution
it must be hard on you terrorists now you can't rape that prisoner any more or make a propaganda film of her execution
the daesh are getting too thin on manpower to hold all the fronts where they need to fight bombing does have an effect
suddenly the daesh murderers of children pretend to care about children but it's just propaganda
yeah it's called caring about human life idiot - something a genocidal daesh would'nt understand
islam declared war on all humanity years ago so talking about murderers of muslims is total hypocrisy
with it's jihad cornerstone islam is a religion that was designed for those that would rather loot and rape for a living than work
one christ terror group that no longer exist is what scum like you use to rationalize mus terror groups
need i say more destroy islam before it destroys us
do you have a way to kill the daesh scum that are hiding behind civilians with hurting civilians
what does isis do that your pedophile prophet did not do
take your stupid cult superstition and stick it up your behind
islam worships a phony nonexistent terrorist god they would be better off worshiping rocks
the assumption that is just another religion already fooled a lot of ppl islam is about war amp world domination http
what - are you stupid there is nothing that compares to the inhumanity and barbarity of islam
mohammed was a murderer who beheaded jews in one day and sold their women and children into slavery
mohammed was a murderer who had people killed for disagreeing with him
mohammed was a rapist who raped young girls and approved of the rape of slaves
the fact is that mohammed was every bit as vile and sick as isis he is their model
and you lie again the majority of muslims were forced into it
mohammed ran two jewish tribes out of medina and stole their property
mohammed attacked the third jewish tribe in medina beheaded all of it's men sold all the rest to slavery
mohammed later attacked the jews of khybar slaughtered many and also stole their property
so while he murdered thousands of jews you talk about visiting some sick neighbor idiot
you lie again the quran and hadith do tell you to murder non believers
i take the whole sura microbrain you make such statement trying to hide the barbarity of islam
there is no love and respect in the quran it is full of hatred bigotry sexism and incitement to murder
any idiot lawyer could make the case that the quran should be outlawed on the basis of being hate speech
furthermore telling people that they should be tolerant of a wholly intolerant religion is idiotic
i already brought you proof straight from my qurans if you refuse to read it then shut up and leave
another lie about the few bad seed all the polls show muslim extremism
yes he's vile because he is against a religion that has produced more than terroris groups
scum bag isis supporters will say anything to justify their barbaric behavior
so what is to blame for the more than islamist terrorists organizations the book of mormon
looks like you are the ignorant asshole in that there is no other religion that has close to that number
islam declared war on all humanity hundred years ago so hide your head up your butt if you like
but islam is the source and dealing with the symptom accomplishes zero after isis and the rest will be more
it already is a war islam has been at war for years ignorant cowardly people try to hide from the fact
how idiotic there never were more than million native americans and most died from diseases
and while we move on islam goes backwards because their canon demand it
what's your point islam declared war on all humanity years ago time to respond in kind
the stages of the islamic demographic jihad = gt
he couldn't be close to the idiot you are terrorism has been rampant in me years
the islamist were there the whole time it was only the dictators that kept them quite
yeah this is bad they should take isis example put them in a cage and torch them all
may allah piss on him before giving him his virgin pigs
and celebratory shouts of fuck allah could be heard all over the us now daesh pussies will fight real soldiers
have they told the tribe yet that their daughters would become whores for sexual jihad
and if you are over you will have to go and die for baghdadi next week
it's okay your pedophile prophet used catapults against cities and killed civilians all the time
poor daesh now they can't rape her torture her or make an execution video of her
don't rely on a single case read the pact of umar
go read what the pact says and don't waste my time
there are no jews in saudi or many of the gulf states because the muslims exterminated them
there was no golden age jews were regularly slaughter by muslims in pogroms
any achievements by jews in spain was despite islam not because of it
where the muslims followed the example of mohammed and continued to murder them
the jews initially all lived in muslim lands the vast majority now live in christian lands
and of course the reason the majority now live in christian lands is muslim abuse
read ibn warraq on the treatement of jews and other minorities in muslim history
the jews were always more educated and productive than the backward muslims
muslims didn't invent mathematics greeks and indians started algebra before muslims
go read about the history of algebra the few small contributions from mus came from conquered ppl
there was no muslim golden age those states were always slave states
those muslim states survived off the sweat of slaves and the intellect of minorities
without muslims science would be exactly where it is today they made zero contrib to comp science
science was moving forward in india and persia before islam islam only slowed it down
finally the backwards effects of islam ground progress in muslim countries to a halt
and for the last years muslims have contributed virtually nothing to science
islam is the religion of hatred and bigotry
notice how most of the contributions are from persians not arabs and are despite islam
and notice that the persian culture was more advanced and advancing and discovering before islam
degrassie is not a historian
euclid uses algorithms long before islam existed so stop with the garbage
yes muslims including their prophet revel in their illiteracy
mohammed never looked for knowledge he believed in jinn was illiterate believed dogs ere devil
why do you think israel is most technological country in that part of world
because islam makes people stupid
a word of advice until you can show that wikiislam is false don't bother me with your advice
their best age by any objective measure you want to apply is now in secular usa
i'd rather deal with a clown hopped up on mushrooms than a muslim filled with the hatred of islam
opinions are opinions far more jews live in western nations than where they originated
where they live tells you everything you need to know namely that islam is a religion of bigotry
even with what hitler did to jews still more want to live in the west than under hatefilled islam
after watching the shia militia beat a peshmerga to death i've concluded that they are animals just like isis
video supposedly showing shia militia killing a solider calling him kaka which means mr in kurdish has gone viral among
is that suppose to be some kind of stupid excuse for the barbarity of the shia militia
dangerous to outsource iraq security to shia militia known for disappearances amp executions
is their idea of fair and equal representation to beat peshmerga to death
it's called reproductive imperialism and was first advocated by their pedophile prophet
why haven't you and your world stopped over islamic terrorist organizations from murdering children
why haven't you stopped the sick muslims from trying to exterminate israel
and if we stop assad who will replace him but a bunch of islamofascists that are even worse
they are not protected under islam islam declared war on all humanity years ago
hamas has been launching rockets at israel forever
i know this because all of the people fighting against assad now are islamofascists
no muslims were too dumb to invent nukes but they use everything they can steal
that is the fault of the terrorist who are hiding behind the women and children blame them
i made isis rise what are you talking about islam created that monster
they could never choose islam has given them nothing but caliphates and dictatorships for years
furthermore your pedo prophet attacked cities with catapults killing children so what are you crying about
swedish media lie to protect somali muslim gang-rapists
this is an idiotic study made with an objective in mind terrorism is not included in the murder rate
furthermore many muslim countries don't even have a record system to account for all murders
and muslims have much higher statistical crime rates in non muslim countries than the non muslims
graphic of growth of radical islam following years of care nurture coddling by us democrats
what an incredible piece of garbage the muslims crusaded against the christians years before christian crusades
islam invaded and conquered of christiandom before any christian crusades in response the writer is a liar
regarding slavery the slaves in america were initially sold by muslim slavers christians got rid of slavery on their own
islam maintained slavery much longer than christianity and only gave it up under western pressure
mohammed the cancer of murder hatred slavery bigotry and sexism for mankind
these days might and honor come from science technology humanitarianism which is why muslims won't get any
the islamic golden age was driven by slavery and looting the jihadis are too lazy and stupid to produce anything
muslims have these delusions about producing algebra but many others beat them to it
which is why they win of all nobel prizes and create all the technology that muslims use and were too stupid to invent
democracy only means that people get to elect their leaders islam means they are ruled by freak god
lol look at you with a towel wrapped around your head pretty freaky
most of mohammed's military expeditions were offensive
mohammed always lied saying he had to attack because others planned to attack him
we are suppose to believe that muslims defended themselves all the way to europe amp india
but the quran and hadith make it clear that islam is imperialist
i just gave you the proof from the quran and the hadiths that you are lying
the quran is not a history book all of it is instructions to man for all time
there are zero lies that westerners create it all comes from your own quran and hadiths
and is this a lie that westerners created
wrong mohammed was a liar rapist murderer slave trader caravan robber sexist biggot
islam is the most decisive hatefilled backward thing that has ever happened to mankind
every day we get the results of the hatred bred by islam
every day we see that muslims hate freedom democracy justice
mankind must outlaw islam because it will never stop it's hatred
they don't misinterpret and most muslims are extremists
for every jew like that there are thousands of muslims like that
muslims rape and enslave ezidi women who did nothing and you give me this
did they should god is great did they burn them in a cage
you are comparing a few thousand jewish extremists with a few million muslim extremists
because most of them are muslims and most are impoverished
and while christianity moved past it's barbarity islam keeps returning to it
yes unlike the gulf muslim countries where they still behead and won't let women drive
since muslims are sworn to exterminate them why shouldn't they
and west killed the guy who killed the million jews in muslim world hitler was hero
japan was the original aggressor how does that excuse the continuing barbarity of islam
yes the muslims murdered million indians
the muslims sold the slaves mohammed owned slaves quran supports slavery
yes there is even more rape in muslim countries but it is not reported
if a raped woman doesn't have four witnesses she will be punished further under islam
yes jews are tired of being murdered by muslims so what

pieces of shit like you are doing everything in your power to exterminate white people
labor tells raped girls to go home and not bother them the filthy animals
muslims have been raping white girls with labor's approval for years any ukip just got there
now you assholes continue to victimize those girls by trying to create distractions while letting the rapists go free
a new blow to by burning people is a new trend they are starting what next castrating enemies on air
come back for a chat when you get a brain
the inmates of aushwitz didn't fire rockets at anyone and the muslims loved the nazis fail
not by illiterate baby rapists like you and your prophet
wheras islam simply declared war on all humanity years ago and has never stopped time to return the favor
peace you idiot islam declared war on all humanity years ago how can you blab on about peace time to exterminate islam
humanity struggled for hundreds of years to rid itself of the blight of slavery leave it to the filth of to bring it right back

kind of the same thing the prophet mohammed did
what do you care scumbag you murder and enslave unarmed ezidi and christian civilians
nice of isis to get them together in one place so we can take out the trash

oh good that get's them out from behind the civilians so that the peshmerga can kill them
even muslims don't want to live under a dictatorship and everybody living in isis land hates them
that's the disadvantage of following a religion of uneducated morons so that you have to rely on kufir for everything
we all saw cantlie's video of how kobane was entirely taken by the daesh and only mopping up was left we are still laughing
daesh murdered three thousand unarmed ezidi civilians in cold blood and enslaved their women you want sympathy idiot
looks like a slum as people are forced to go to mosque at gun point daesh are creating hundreds of thousands of atheists
he says while immersed in kufiri invented and built devices
too bad the caliphate is too stupid to create it's own twitter madrassas only produce morons
the next step in warfare is the ground drone a robot that will walk up to the jihadi and blow out his brains
the ground drone will be bullet proof and carry small rockets to intercept rpgs
the phony allah worshiping madrassa rats will die at the hands of controllers a thousand miles away
the end result being that the jihadi will be turned into a piece of outdated garbage with zero real world value
scum bag islamists evacuated all the christian and ezidi civilians from their homes in mosul raqqa sinjar
are those the ezidi children murdered by muslims
and they would be right the quran and hadith clearly declared war on all mankind years ago
don't be an idiot there are more than muslim terrorist organizations no other religion has anything close
don't be an idiot the quran and the hadith declared war on all mankind years ago time for mankind to declare war
so you just blow off the ones murdered by the islamists using dead kids for your religious objectives
coming from a scum bag that practices religious bigotry
did you learn that logic in a madrassa
madrassa math daesh threw manpower at kobane in far disproportion to it's size
painting others as inhuman is exactly what the quran does to non-believers
don't complain about bigotry when you practice a religion of bigotry
islam is a pile of hatred murder bigotry sexism islam is filth that has divided and destroyed mankind
why beheadings because it's in the book
australia lebanese muslim husband -year-old pregnant wife arrested sexual abuse http
thanks for showing again that blacks are the biggest racists blocked
when you wake up tomorrow you will find that daesh reports were as real as your virgin pigs
allah scewed up when he planned on kobane now the free citizens of kobane are rebuilding
sharia law is far more evil than outlawing a few vices here
teaching me about discrimination implies via the link that critiquing islam is like being a homophobe http
at that point in time america thought that islam was just a normal religion now we know that it is a piece of filthy imperialism
since muslims don't speak out against their terrorists why should we
correct islamic permission to rape salve girls
my ass at least half of them are murderous lunatics
that is another one of the common lies all muslims tell to westerners
i have four translations of the quran it is a murderous hate mongering piece of filth
muslims kill times that many innocent non muslims every day so i don't care
this is kiddie stuff compared to what muslims do every day
the jews are trying to defend themselves against muslims trying to exterminate them
islam is the murder of million citizens of the earth by scum shouting allahu akbar
of course that is because islam is a religion of murder and other muslims are in rifle range
but isis never attacked muslims like they did ezidis killing them as non believers
all the land that islam holds came from war and murder the us does not occupy a single country anywhere
not nearly to the extent that they went insane over a mohammed cartoon
you can stop the one muslim nonsense look at what the muslims tell the pollsters
the difference is that islam has a requirement for jihad has over large terrorist orgs and declared war on world
the world is doing nothing islam is producing the terrorist activities and has been for years
every religion and non religion on the planet is at war with islam every border with a muslim state is a bloody border
yes the western world was unaware of the layer of islamolunatics that lived under the thumbs of the dictators
and that meant that once the dictators were gone the islamolunatics would try to disrupt democracy with violence
unfortunately real islam as defined in the quran and hadith is too backwards and inhuman even for most me muslims
and since islam declared war on all humanity humanity must return the favor and declare war on islam
how many muslims there are is irrelevant the declaration of war on mankind is clearly spelled out in quran and hadiths
it's muslims that do virtually all the killing for example of civilians killed in afghanistan are killed by taliban
hamas was elected once and have not had elections since they have skipped many elections mursi was going in same direction
and if muslims are angry that they can't force islam on people who cares
wrong apostacy is the equivalent of leaving america and becoming a citizen of another country there is no penalty
the hypocrisy of islam is that they expect to convert people from other religions but they murder converts from their own
and furthermore they murder anyone who tries to convert a muslim but demand the freedom to convert non muslims
islam is an entire religion built on intolerance and jihad it's time for the world to stop tolerating it
actually muslims enslaved far more than anyone else the prophet mohammed was a slave trader jesus had no slaves
but the western world gave up slavery on it's own no one forced them from the outside
and now every jihadi group wants to reinstate slavery in the present because the quran approves it and mohammed practiced
so if you are against slavery you cannot be a muslim so why are you crying about slavery when the quran approves it
the first slaughterers were the muslims they invaded the christian world years before the crusades
the muslims conquered of the christian world before it attacked back so again what are you crying about
the muslims also invaded india and murdered million hindus they virtually exterminated all buddhist on in india
the muslims attacked and murdered the zoastrians in persia and the buddhists in afghanistan
no minorities of any kind are left in saudi and several other gulf states having been exterminated by muslims
now muslim terror groups are trying to complete the job of killing or throwing out any remaining minority groups in arabia
because while other groups can evolve the violence of the quran and hadith prevent islam from ever being a human religion
the lesson the world learned about islam is that when we get rid of their brutal dictators they are replaced by brutal islamists
islam declared war on all mankind years ago now we return the favor
isis continues their big successes against unarmed civilians they just can't win a fight against anything but families
mohammed owned slaves so if you are against slavery you are against mohammed otherwise you are just bull shiting
but your whole conversation about slavery is phony bull shit propaganda since you follow a slave owner prophet
good we have established that muslims are slavers and that their humanity has failed to evolve past slave owning
by practicing islam you are vomiting on all jews christians and non believers check code of umar
it's not a prophet competition it's about following a fraud who owned slaves had people murdered was a bigot etc
killing people because they believe differently than you and express that is not an excuse for murder except among muslims
i have no fear of idiots like you at all what turns my stomach is the destruction to freedom and humanity that islam causes
islam is a pile of manure that destroys human freedom human life human expression and creates endless divisiveness
oh please lecture me about porn when muslims are the worlds biggest porn consumers and islamic heaven is a brothel
islam has never been a resistance to oppression it has always been source of oppression to both believers and non believer
islam has hadiths that tell you what hand to use to wipe your ass there is zero room for individualism in it
islam is a slave religion both for it's followers and for the people it enslaves and for the dhimmis it rules
i wouldn't be too concerned about that because outside the canon of islam there is no historical evidence of mohammed
that's how muslims react when the traffic light turns red
good tweet but they actually start selling their daughters at
europe needs to expel their muslim immigrants
-yr-old sold as slave to a -yr-old man said she didn't know what rape meant- only that she woke up bleeding http
it's not about a single terrorist there are an endless supply of them it's about a hate cult called islam
arab slave trade to million non-muslim slaves from all colors and nationalities - still happening today
may allah bless him with virgin pigs
roflmao where is the picture daeshbag
nobody cares about your stupid rationalizations we are simple going to kill all the daesh hope you are one of em
let's stop pretending and get the war between the islamolunatics and the rest of the world started now
and some idiots want to support the muslims that are trying to exterminate israel
how long before some idiot politician tells us that this is not about islam but about some islamic extremist
the logic of islam reflects clearly in those who follow its ideology and oaths to be muhammad's slave
islam's war on women continues islam continues to show how they value women
you are a total liar just like your pedophile prophet un soldiers don't burn people alive
problem with vile muslims is that they try to rationalize amp excuse the crimes of islam rather than get rid of them
and looking at your page i can see that you are in the business of photoshopping images islamist cocksucker
this is why the world knows that muslims are taqiyya liars that manufacture fraudulent data
this coming from a muslim hypocrite religion that declared war on humanity and are population imperialists
as usual he will say that islamist terrorism has nothing to do with islam
i'm totally sick of these politically expedient statements after every attack by islam on humanity
capital hill is a great example of how seldom the world attacks islam given the daily provocations
yeah break relations with the only me democracy that the muslims are trying to exterminate smart
muslim terrorist execute people daily but when rare response happens to that provocation they fake being the victims
ask the muslims they are the ones killing all the jews
again you are the liar muslims invaded europe years before the crusades
muslims invaded and conquered of christianity before christians responded so stick your lies
islam is a hate mongering death cult that declared war on humanity that fact should be talked about
furthermore your heroes the taliban are responsible for the murder of of afghan civilians so stick it asshole
the asshole prophet mohammed who was a slave trader pedophile murderer war monger sexist bigot caravan robber
yeah i know being a human being is against islam islam must be outlawed
a shit sucking muslim bigot like you wouldn't recognize history if it crawled up your cunt you think photoshop is a truth machin
why would i care about the opinion of a guy who follows a pedophile prophet
islam was made for stupid violent lying criminal useless thugs and you fill the bill exactly
you dumb asshole he legalized slavery he raped slave girls he was a pedophile how can you call him great anything
these morons that you show talking about mohammed give no facts and knew nothing about him
look the heroes of the torah exterminated every man woman child and animal in some cities
so if i say that you must be a murdering fascist because you follow that book am i right
those jews are assholes most jews are secular and humanist most muslims are islamists
if you don't think that muslims invaded christianity and europe first you are to historically ignorant
of the time you muslims play the victim card it's a lie and the reverse is true
read the statistics microbrain look at the percentage of the worlds muslims that want to kill apostates
what matters is that people like you are trying to lay a guilt trip on us while ignoring the truth
not masked the quran and the hadith declared war on humanity years ago
and says they drink wine in heaven so islamic heaven is basically a drunken whore house very spiritual - lol
there are over islamic terrorist organizations kkk virtually dead there is no canceling out
because christianity is dying out and the christian world has reformed itself
but islam keeps trying to return to the th century
islam cannot be reformed because it's vileness is too deep in the religion
mohammed was a murderer jesus wasn't mohammed was a rapist jesus wasn't
mohammed was a slave trader jesus wasn't mohammed was a sexist jesus wasn't
mohammed led military expeditions beheaded jews in one day married a six year old girl etc etc get the picture
there is no comparing the vileness of mohammed to jesus or buddha or lao tse he was simply a criminal
and he was also a total fraud he made up the verses of the quran when he needed them as he needed
the great left lie is that it's just a handful of extremists
and the christian world got rid of slavery by itself the muslim world was pressured into getting rid of it and now returns to it
again you are an idiot others did bad things so we have to ignore the barbarity of islam
who cares if it has been revised a million times what does that have to do with the barbarity of islam
yeah and don't you waste your time hating homophones sexists and racists are you going to do that
you are defending the prophet mohammed and he was a murderer sexist imperialist and bigot
i'm telling you that the religion of islam is guilty of the murder of million citizens of the earth and i will not
have some pc pandered tell me to accept a cult of hate
the followers of the religion give a shit about the prophet of the religion he is their example and always will be
a religion who has a murdering hating pedophile at it's core has no room to be reformed
by hating the ideaology that enables it that is what i'm doing
islam is not a race microbrain it is a religion you can always tell a leftist because when he runs out of arguments he
the question is not about people doing bad things it is about the religion supporting and demanding those things
okay show me where buddha or lao tse ever hurt anyone or advocated anyone be hurt
buddha said that slavery was unacceptable years before the slave trader mohammed came along
so if a buddhist owns a slave you can say that he goes against his religion but a muslim slave owner is not going against his
this means that if you want to establish a humanist ideaology islam will get in the way much more than buddhism
chomsky is a racist islam created isis
but there are thousands of lone nut cases all motivated by islam
obama implies murder of muslims in nc is religious bigotry but terrorists slaughtering jews in a paris kosher deli is a
'no compulsion in religion' qu'ran think again
read an islamist's tweet insane life denying heartless
being nice islam is like hugging a serial killer and thinking he will stop bur
mt is now the only major muslim majority country in the middle east that is not bombing
islam created that monster and islam has been creating them for years
after the recent rape-murder case of a female turkish student other turkish women are telling their stories to the worl
one way of helping to prevent such crimes would be to outlaw the sick and sexist religion of islam that victimizes women
on the contrary the brutal bigoted sexist god of islam encourages the abuse of women
the sunni turkmen are genocidal criminals living off loot they stole from minorities what they want counts for nothing
my point is that mohammeds example us used by some muslim men to justify their paedophilia
eventually followed by no future for christians in uk eventually followed by no future for atheists in uk
yes all that islam is making isis so loving idiot
it's basically an empty excuse that leftists and muslims use for their anti us bigotry
that's just as big a fallacy as the oil fallacy the us had zero to do with the creation of al queda
unlike you i do read before making assumptions i read all of the quran and many of the hadiths that is how i know it's vile
the fact that there were two layers of evil to be dealt with in iraq doesn't mean they should both be left alone
the parallel between the behavior of terrorist organizations and the prophet mohammed is something i've preached for year
guys in guantanamo are militants captured in war people in isis cages are women and children microbrain
the jihadists fight for the interest of the caliph and the pedophile prophet not for the interest of the people
gee last week it was the nazis this week the zionists next week the martians never has such a fool used the buddha
after committing genocide and murdering countless civilians scum bag deash try to use babies for propaganda
islam is the perpetuity of oppression and i thank isis for helping the world to kill islam
so tell me what could possible happen that you would consider to be proof that allah and mohammed were frauds
yeah i read that and every verse of the tao te ching is superior to every verse of the quran so quran is fraud
i've seen it before microbrain i just told you every verse of the tao te ching is superior to every verse of quran
you challenge has been accepted you have been given better verses proving the quran is a fraud
actually they follow the quran and the hadiths exactly it's the moderate muslims who ignore much of their canon
i read the entire quran and much of the hadiths i know more about islam than most muslims it is a curse to all mankind
the muslims are the crusaders microbrain
and if someone risks their life to save me from a mass grave they are welcome to my tv and toaster
no islam declared war on all humanity years ago so all non believers despise islam
islam was designed to benefit th cent bedouin thugs rapist murderers slavers caravan robbers
sure why do one third of muslims want to murder people who want to leave islam
why do nearly half of all muslims want to kill people for who they have sex with
why do of all muslims want sharia which demands death for homosexuals and apostates
and how about if we investigate the hate speech in the quran
the saudis will arm sunni rebels in yemen civil war is inevitable
whatever happens in when it is over the country will be in the hands of one islamofascist group or another
the question is how hard should we work to keep the muslims from killing each other since they seem so determined to continue
proper grammer islam phobia is not a medical condition it is truth
the quran is an incoherent piece of garbage created for mental midgets
they have been beheading christians jews buddhist hindus ezidis etc for years their prophet did it from the start
most of the christians that were a part of the palestinians have been killed or driven out by palestinian muslims
as long as the middle east is in the grip of there will never be such a thing as an arab spring
there is no difference in what the prophet mohammed did and in what isis does
wrong they were connected to the muslim brotherhood and they were anti semitic bigots
islamophobia is like the idea of naziphobia islam is a religion of hate and it must be outlawed
pigs like you never whine so loud at the hundreds of murders by muslims every day around the world
show me your posts about the christians murdered on blasphemy charges pig
outlaw islam
war chopping off heads raping slave girls were mohammed's favorite activities
saudi would be a big joke if it wasn't crushing the lives of millions of people
saudi cleric believes earth does not revolve around sun there must be ways to return to the th century with as your expert guide
knowledge and muslim clerics = non intersecting sets
why do isis the saudis and the taliban imprison women in their homes because the quran tells them to
saudi sewer qurans what a perfect idea and what a perfect place for a quran
saudi arabia sewer qurans when you can't express your hatred for islam in words throw them in the sewer
why do saudis pakistanis isis and taliban brutalize their women because islam tells them to
the drivel is correct isis behaves exactly as the prophet mohammed behaved
he had a couple of solutions the one i like is to defeat isis at dabiq breaks the prophecy
wrong isis follows the example of mohammed and the quran exactly
the kurds clean up the isis islamofascist trash in kobane kobane is the graveyard of isis via
and what are the muslim scholars going to do say you caught us our religion is violent and barbaric
the atlantic got it exactly right and every point in thinkprogress is easily refuted
for example the literary style of the quran is always very literal little use of metaphors etc
the peaceful q verses are pre medina mecca verses when mohammed had little power and was endangered
the later verses abrogated the earlier verses and what remains is violent and imperialist
the example of mohammed gives us a man who owned slaves raped women beheaded jews in one day
the objective of the article is to invalidate islam not to validate isis and islam should be outlawed
isis shines a spotlight on the barbarity of islam but isis did not create that barbarity it simply follows it to the letter
nobody declared war on allah and his pedophile messenger islam's war is all started by islam
there are no scholars in islam superstition is not a subject for scholars
are we going to continue seeing the oppression of women or are we going to make a stand
if you don't follow what is in the sunnah you don't follow what is in the sunnah i could care less about your indignation
who cares isis does what mohammed did tens of thousands also do and have joined him muslims crazy
a again give me a verse number that shows that isis is not following islam
it's all hot air mohammed clearly burned people as shown by the hadith i gave you
and not only did mohammed burn them the crucified stoned and beheaded people
to say don't hate islam is as dumb as saying don't hate nazism
chapel hill is not surprising what is surprising is that given the level of islamic terrorism there is so little
now if anyone in the west said that you would go balistic but for islam you are a pandering ass kisser
islam defines women as little more than slaves but you defend islam and call me mysoginistic
the quran sanctifies sexual slavery i only wish that you could have been one of these
that which your right hand posses means slave the quran gives clear permission to rape slaves
we are wasting our time with kelly she is willing to stab million women in the back just to be pc
yes those millions that won't let women drive in saudi vote in kuwait and cut their clits all over
those law abiding muslims that have a domestic violence rate in pakistan and murder people for blasphemy
isis land and mauritania the birth place of islam didn't give up slavery until chechens still have it
so now you admit that the quran sanctifies sexual slavery and try to change the subject
and they all use the same barbaric quran and hadiths and they all abuse women
since the islamist erdogan came to power women's employment in turkey fell he considers them baby machines
the muslim citizens of raqqa enjoying a peaceful day of beating three men to death
i don't care who they are they might as well claim that they are scholars in witchcraft they are madrassa rats
and madrassa rats are always stupid like the one who just claimed that the sun goes around the earth
since islam has already declared war on mankind mankind needs to declare war back on islam
we don't support tyrants islam produces nothing but tyrants all the caliphs and sultans were tyrants
if the muslim world ever produced anything but tyrants dictators fascists and fanatics we would support them
the people who were killed were supporters of the muslim brotherhood young terrorists in the making
nobody gives a fuck about the streets when you are practicing genocide murder and slavery microbrain
muslims assumed a bomb threat was from an anti-muslim infidel targeting them http
obama and his love for golf is greater that love for christians or jews
either that murdering scum wins or the murdering sexist genocidal islamist scum wins either way scum wins
fuck these people that want to steal our freedom of speech for the sake of a fascist religious ideology
turkey is islamist let them pay the price for islamofasicsm europe and us are secular don't want islamolunatics
giuliani watched his city attacked amp people jump to their deaths he's entitled to say wtf he wants about the guy shield
all westerners didn't subscribe to nazi ideology all muslims subscribe to the religion of hatered murder and bigotry
allah the terrorist can stick what he wants up his giant ass
if isis has nothing to do with then why doesn't it attract jews himdus buddhists taoists atheists christians why only muslims
this is a list of lies and baloney that you are presenting it has zero to do with the quran and hadiths
islam is and insult to all mankind time to insult the disgusting religion back
had nothing to do with islam mohammed's first wife was a rich merchant before islam
islam does nothing but freeze the status of women to the th century
islam treats women like slaves and anyone who says otherwise is stabbing women in the back
i just told you that women owned property before islam had nothing to do with islam islam is sexist to the very core
women did't lead squat a woman can never be caliph her testimony is half that of a man she get's nothing for jihad
your religion makes the entire woman a giant sex organ and forces her to hide every bit of it
your religion teaches you to shut up obey your husband stay in your house cover in a tent and calls you stupid
you just proved that you are stupid i just showed you the hadiths where mohammed calls women stupid and you still deny it
i don't have a book i have several hundred books here is a couple that expose the vileness of islam
fsa sold weapons they got from us to the islamofascists
there are many supposed americans that work to destroy america
daesh really go to extremes to stage their propaganda material
the rapist represent islam because it's approved in the quran and hadiths microbrain
so what is god's problem that he needs your submission is he an egotistical jerk
again airhead they died because of hate because islam encourages that hate
a their bodies are far from finishing growth b their minds are far from finishing growth
but the pedophile prophet mohammed only cared about his pecker and his perverted desires
who else are we suppose to talk to in muslim land when they produce nothing but filth
muslims don't produce thomas jeffersons or mahatma ghandis and they don't produce freedom or democracy
they just produce islamolunatics
rofl in your dreams daeshbag
the ezidis were out in the open with no shelter for month because of daeshbags so who cares
attacking innocent unarmed civilians is the only success the daesh have any more
we don't care as long as there are a lot of dead daeshbags they will loose more than they gain
the prophet mohammed didn't bother to help the poor to convert them but rather converted at the point of the sword
this is actually the only kind of job that mujahedeen are intellectually suited for
americans didn't burn any libraries microbrain and even if they did why punish iraqis by burning their libraries dumbo
daesh followers of the pedophile prophet mohammed and the terrorist allah are dying in their rage and in their thousands
i hope they just outlaw the vile religion of islam entirely they should have done it years ago
just like there was years ago the flies are free
we all assume that societies will progress but forces societies to regress afghanistan and now
islam = the destroyer of human rights women's rights western feminists = the defenders and enablers of islam
mostly it shows how vile inhuman digusting and barbaric that religion is
saying that islam is a way of life means that it tells you that you cannot have democracy and must instead follow a pedophile
saying that is a way of life means that human freedom is forbidden and the inhuman laws of a criminal must be followed
fuck allah the phony god of islam and terrorism outlaw now
true and most of them were from well off families and their radicalization follows their increased attendance at mosques
so we bombed hitler and various dictators because they refused to be slaves muslims need to get a grip on reality
there you go you just showed why islam is a vile and inhuman religion
all fought against fascist dictatorial or islamolunatic regimes for example
of afghan civilians are killed by taliban so it is a service to mankind to bomb the taliban
islam doesn't answer anything it pretends to answer with illogical and delusional superstition
if muslims ever produced a decent leader the world would be overjoyed to accept him
as a certified inmate of the islamasylum you don't have the ability to judge
another case of if you say islam is violent we will kill you
years ago islam stole all women's rights and turned them into slaves forever
to allow muslims to pervert our us constitutional rights via domestic mosques and islam teaching is outrageous
that's because gaza is full of jihadi criminals who have never done a days work in their lives
considering the endless stream of murders against minorities by muslims who cares
there is no such thing as islamophobia that is like saying there is naziphobia
you are the one who believes in a god that asks one part of his creation to murder another part impossible to get any stupider
and there is the next thing that is wrong with muslims most of you are liars were killed by taliban
and it is muslims who were the first crusaders attacking the christian world for centuries before it attacked back
you are lying again just like a muslim the quran approves of raping slave girls explicitly
futhermore islam is based on theft mohammed raised his armies by giving them of everything they stole
the saudis were the mujahedeen before there was any involvement of the us
but it really doesn't matter who the mujahedeen animals are fighting they have been murdering someone for years
taqiyya is used by all muslims mohammed was a liar who often lied for islam
because islamic canon are a pack of contradictory idiocy in other hadiths mohammed says to kill all dogs
i'm not interested in your sectarian divisions shia and sunni are all following the vile pedophile prophet
i don't care if they are shia islamolunatics or sunni islamolunatics the are all filth to me
the reason why mohammed's thugs went to war was to get what they could steal
the hadiths are the sunnah of the prophet microbrain so you can't throw out the ones you don't like
lol first you deny that islam permits the rape of slave girls then you verify it get lost i'm tired of you
perish slowly my ass slavery lasted longer in the muslim world that anywhere else and your hero is trying to bring it back
another cheap muslim lie give me proof of any muslim that was punished for not being kind to the slave girls they raped
not only do that but they can dump their wives leaving them nothing by saying three times i divorce you barbaric
you really are a raving islamolunatic our soldiers are never ever allowed to rape anyone if they do they have broken the law
but in islam they can rape captive women to their hearts content and there is no law against it
if is so against idols that they smash assyrian and buddhists statues then why do they pray at mecca and circumambulate the kabba
again you are a muslim liar mohammed said nothing about stray and most civilized countries try to find strays homes
people who hate the nazis are not extremists and there is no diff between islam and nazis
considering what those local arabs did to kurds christians assyrians ezidiz etc who cares
as long as it's not an islamolunatic in power that forces sharia on people who don't want it who cares
good anything is better than having islamofascists in power
and no doubt your friend was every place where isis could have been murdering children
then why do you smelly rag heads keep moving to britian
the muslim pedophiles do this all the time it's so common and accepted that it's not even news
the intellect of a muslim cretin who thinks allah made all mankind so one part could make war on another
as expected when the terrorist group hamas won the election in gaza it was the usual one man one vote one time islamist election
these campaigns are all lies that try to portray islam to the west as being the exact opposite of what it really is - barbaric
read it liberals amp get a reality check on life within islam your views beliefs any democracy system mean nothing http
the fact that i have a brain prevents me from accepting islam
islam is in the news everyday not for good works but for it's savage evil
buddha forbid slavery years before mohammed jesus had no slaves years before mohammed but mohammed was forced to have
as usual you are a muslim liar making any excuses for a religion of barbarity murder hatred and sexism and now you are blocked
maybe the media didn't have space after reporting the about the thousands murdered by muslims that week
the apharthide is a muslim thing they have exterminated jews and christians in most of me
and the quran says that the muslims must steal and occupy the entire world
fuck you every palestinian school teaches children to hate jews and kuffir
who cares the only issue is are they guilt or innocent all the rest is race baiting by assholes like you
female engineers make comp to male engineers so without specific professional comparisons your info is useless
i know that the palestinians are a group of murdering terrorists that provide no human rights to their population
i know that the terrorist organization hamas has not had another election since their first one
i know that they force the same sexism hatred and bigotry on their population that all islamolunatics do
i know that they teach their kids to hate jews but they teach them nothing that is needed to run a country or economy
i know that they are dedicated to the extermination of the jews just like their prophet mohammed was
i know that muslim bigotry has driven all the christians out of palestine
the sahara and the arabian peninsula are different places microbrain
islam declared war on all humanity years ago while individual muslims may or may not be terrorist islam is terrorist
no the money comes from muslims around the world who want a caliphate and the domination of islam by force
factual evidence there were never more than million native american indians on the north american continent
there is no such thing as islamophobia just as there is no such thing as naziphobia
they are not as stupid as you since islam is not a race
furthermore those jews were not nomads in fact the city of medina was established by jews before mohammed attacked them
the daesh rats keep announcing victories at the same time they keep loosing men and land the world is laughing at them
seems like being a muslim and living off a steady diet of conspiracy theories go together islam is a religion of ignorance
no matter how desperately race baiting trash like you want islam to be a race it's not
islamophobia is like naziphobia it's an abuse of language for political gain it looks like this
islamophobia - fear of this
islamophobia - fear of this
islamophobia - fear of this
islamophobia - fear of this
islamophobia - fear of this
he's lying there is nothing that isis does that the prophet mohammed did not also do
he is lying it's islam isis does nothing that the prophet mohammed did not also do
the islamic communities have proven themselves to be violent lunatics
forcing others to accept the barbarity of islam is actual obligation
that's because it's all about the barbarity of islam not the beards
there is no choice ban islam or it will destroy humanity
the islam is the hate microbrain
one of the vile things about islam is that it murders people for exercising their freedom of speech
balance what the hate cult of islam has zero place in american schools
there is no reason at all why a hate cult cannot be banned
muslims train babies to hate and murder then use them for propaganda
so which ones are the moderate muslims
i read the entire quran and many of the hadiths and murdering unbelievers and forcing islam on people is exactly what it is
the term islamophobia is like the term naziphobia - stupid
what about current slavery afraid of islam http
good time to confront the cult of hatred and murder
exactly
no but if you are following a quran that has hatred and bigotry in it it makes you a hateful bigot
it is justice to punish your parents if they taught you murder like islam teaches murder
it doesn't count for the vile people practicing vile islam
and islam is the cause of what the radicals are doing because the prophet mohammed did the same things and they follow him
you are the liar he beheaded jewish men in one day and sold their women and children into slavery
really don't you know anything about your evil religion
you are living under severe delusions the reason mohammed so hated jews was because so few were willing to convert
you can never get rid of the radical muslims because the quran and hadiths will always produce more
quran would be a good example of terrorism
no one will cut my head off or sell me into slavery the only thing that will happen is the irs will take some of my
the hate atmosphere is built into islam so extinguish it
liar those hadith come from the usc muslim student association hadith web site and here is more
both the muslim men and their religious texts abuse women
muslim people insult themselves by the vile religion they follow and their extremism
ottoman enderun schools were converting centers for non-muslim kidnapped children now folowing them with yazidis http
if someone is going to die getting isis out of it may as well be the shia militia that is all good
is full of nonsense amp i proved it i rest my case
so now you taquiyya liars deny what is explicit in the quran
too stupid hamas is a murdering terrorist group that forces islamist oppression on everyone the can
good by marching on israeli checkpoint the women were obviously trying to create a confrontation
muslim bigots constantly create confrontations and then whine to the world about results
if the islamofascist lunatics stopped attacking israel there would be peace
normally dress should be a personal choice in islam it is a symbol of oppression
every border that islam has with every other religion and non religion is bloody
leave it to a muslim to claim four translators are lying rather than admit the truth
i also know that you are lying because i have three translated qurans that say the same thing as the translations i gave you
but thanks for demonstrating for the millionth time how muslims lie about their religion
the badr brigade doesn't liberate anyone they are simply a different flavor of islamofascists
that list of crimes describes what muslims have been doing to jews in the me for years
the muslims have exterminated virtually every minority in the me and these idiots talk about israeli aparthide
wheras the arabs really are behaving people and you scum are ignoring it
every border that islam shares with every other religion is bloody but we are suppose to believe it's the jews fault
jews lived on of the arabian peninsula before the prophet mohammed started exterminating them
every non muslim demographic in every muslim country is shrinking because of attacks from muslims
in many gulf states like saudi there are zero minorities left due to islamic bigotry and apartheid
islam is at war with every other religion and non religion on the planet but idiots claim the fault is the jews
copts are attacked murdered raped and forced to convert in egypt turkey used to be almost all christian
radical islam on the rise in indonesia
so how much freedom of speech is there in gaza and do you jew hating bigots write about that
nice to see bigots like blumenthal fight for people that practice honor killing beating women child marriage homophobia
so why doesn't blumenthal go and ask hamas why they never have elections
jews need to be trained to liberate palestine of muslims who are the real cancer
in palestine a woman like you would have been honor killed long ago
human rights record of animals living in palestine
up your ass terrorist bitch
no the muslim states are the most murderous terrorist states on earth it's not even close
the quran declared war on all humanity that was not muslim
of muslims are killed by other muslims microbrain
islamolunatics have conducted terrorist attacks since
israel is zero threat to world peace every muslim nation on the planet is a threat to world peace
and here is the list of jewish nobel laureats they contribute about times as much as muslims muslims contribute hate
the zionist label is just something scum like you use to attack jews
who cares where they were born camel breath they call themselves israelis and jews
no i'll put you there because being nothing contributes more to mankind than muslims
islam is the cancer of the earth it looks like this
blumenthal fights for palestine which has no freedom of speech has honor killings and beheads gays
muslim files suit against law banning child marriage offends islam
mohammed was a paedophile murderer rapist slave trader bigot sexist caravan robber liar and imperialist
if christianity is banned in muslim countries why do we allow islam here just asking
this jihadi is following in the footsteps of his prophet and marrying young
iraqi shia put sticker khamenei leader of iran near tikrit does it make sense to ask kurds should respect iraq unity http
yeah the lunatic left who want to earn their livelihood by calling people racists don't care for people who work
maybe they are not that anxious to have a bigot like blumenthal encourage even more muslims to murder more jews in france
yeap there is only so much bandwidths for self genocidal jews and it's blumenthal's turn to be the center of attention
max blumenthal is bad mouthing you not enough room at the top for all the self genocidal jews
how can palestine be free when it is ruled by islamofascists that behead gays practice honor killing murder opposition
the entire history of islam is one of colonization occupation hatred and bigotry get an education
isis is different from max's friends hamas isis throws gays off rooftops hamas beheads gays
hamas does however throw their political opponents off roof tops
resents that journalists are reporting on the antisemitism by bdsers at ucla
press for the bds mvmt
impossible to understand how people like blumenthal can rant given years of abuse of jews by muslims
the job mohammed set muslims is not done while israel exists
no it is the muslims that have done the ethnic cleansing for years israel is putting a stop to it
forget about your anti jewish bigotry how do you explain hamas beheading gays and honor killing women
you think hamas doesn't practice cruel and inhuman treatment of palestinians are you blind
hamas throws their political opponents off roof tops is that your idea of humanity
the muslims have never stopped their quest to exterminate jews
yeah being anti zionist is pretending to have an excuse for being anti semitic
filthy taquiyya liar the abuse of women by couldn't be clearer
self genociadal self serving liars
and muslims today are as determined to do that as every generation before them
yes i hate nazis too got a problem with that
i hate islam because it is a religion based on hatred and jihad
mohammed's first wife katjia was a wealthy woman before islam so you are lying
the poor women do it because they marry a muslim man and are pressured into it men do it in prison it's a criminal's relig
islam is hatred and jihad
there is no difference between what isis does and what mohammed did
what is the difference between what isis does and what the prophet mohammed did microbrain
and by the way the entire world hates islam
fuck mohammed was a pedophile murderer bigot sexist rapist slave trader caravan robber and liar
this is lying propaganda if you want to know what filth and hatred islam is just read the quran
people were making scientific discoveries including algebra before islam
islam only served to slow down science the few discoveries by muslims were despite islam not because of islam
but the christian and jewish world had an enlightenment because they got past religion islamic world has never got past religion
look at the kinds of opinions that the islamic world is stuck with
mohammed was a slave trader caravan robber murderer beheader rapist sexist bigot liar and pedophile just like isis
million people were killed by islamolunatics shouting allahu akbar
the islamic world was still in the dark ages before the french showed up
it means god is great often shouted while muslims are murdering one of gods creations
i'm not concerned with single events i'm concerned with years of islamic murder and barbarity that shows no sign of ending
and i know that umar imposed the code of umar making jews and christians third class citizens for centuries
actual muslims know very little about islam
you should be attacking everyone that follows a religious cult of hated and murder like islam
islam declared war on all humanity years ago and denying it is simply a lie
being able to practice their religion doesn't mean that they were not treated as third class citizens
i typed that on there the hadiths are original shut up and go look them up or are you afraid to
i have three translations of the quran microbrain and i know far more about islam than you
if you actually knew about islam you would know how violent and barbaric
the muslims killed millions when they entered europe and india but the question is can we get beyond barbaric religion
but all the crimes of islam are exactly according to their beliefs
isis beheads people saudi beheads people mohammed beheaded jews
mohammed was a slave owner and the quran allows slavery so isis returns to slavery
mohammed raped slave girls the quran approves of the rape of slave girls - so isis rapes slave girls
the quran approves of the beating of women and tells them to stay home so isis does it also
laugh all you want islam is a steaming pile of shit good night blocked
islam only talked about the freeing of slaves who were muslims since mohammed was a slave owner it continued to today good night
did he embrace buddhism or christianity or hinduism and become a terrorist no it's always islam that leads to terrorism
yes let's try to fool people into believing a lie - that is a religion of peace
you're a woman and you're committed to you cannot be serious
fuck the quran
denouncing terrorism and violence means denouncing the heart of islam
but islam is proud of their slavery imperialism and genocide against minorities the are murdering kurds in iran now
iran where there is no human freedom and where they murder kurds gays apostates political opponents
horseshit mohammed led major military expeditions owned slaves had wives - one six years old
mohammed had people murdered who disagreed with him he raped women he married a year old he beheaded jews
here is the quran telling men they can beat their wives and that men are superior
here is the quran telling muslim men that they can rape their slave girls
here is the quran stating that the witness of a woman is worth half that of a man
liar katjia was a business woman before there was islam mohammed worked for her and had no choice about it
you fucking moron slavery is approved right in the quran read it you stupid idiot
yeap this is a big problem the shia militia is only slightly less fanatical and islamofascist than the daesh they are replacing
both daesh and shia militia are driven by a religion of hatred and bigotry and there will be no freedom in tikrit regardless
i don't trust isis or the shia militia both want to force their sick religion on people
the shia militia are terrorists that are only slightly better than isis look at the shia militia in yemen
true but islam is corrupt from the beginning
since of muslim civilians are killed by muslim terrorists you avatar is just propaganda
saudis regard isis as a threat it's who is defeating them that they have a problem with
an islamist human rights group lol now there is a contradiction in terms
rt the true history of and slavery must see
please sign this petition + retweet
good morning here is the history of islamic slavery
do uk enough to understand the history of islamic slavery
the women convert to islam because they marry muslim men men convert in prison
what your prophet said was that women are stupid and corrupt
most of the african slaves were slaves of muslims
you try again mohammed screwed aisha when she was
mohammed raped aishia when she was
of muslim civilians are killed by taliban look it up
okay so we agree that the taliban and isis and saudis are implementing
and isis does what islam requires is just the start
okay so we understand that the quran makes striking a woman an option and that the woman must obey the man
two verses and we can agree that islam tells women to stay home cover up obey your husband right
mohammed was suppose to be guided by god and his example was for all mankind for all time he was not suppose to follow
islam allows men divorce by saying i divorce you three times not women
why not the palestinians behead gays and honor kill women
here are churchill's views about the pedophile prophet
every muslim convert becomes muslim propaganda
islamophobia is like naziphobia there is no such thing
a phobia is an irrational hatred there is no such thing as a phobia for a hatred that is rational
and since islam is a religion of murder bigotry and hatred hating islam is rational
but islam has no truth every word is a lie
australia gifted teen embraces islam becomes a jihad terrorist
here r translations of t quranic verse that gives men the right to beat their wives and declares men superior
the content of the quran and hadiths give islam a bad name
why do muslims force women to cover up and stay at home the quran tells them to
at least i don't follow pedophile prophets or believe in mythical creatures of fire called jinn
talk to me about being dumb when you figure out how to get working toilets into the pakistani public schools
a it's not the fastest growing religion it's the fastest breeding religion
b the only reason there are non muslims on the earth is because the non muslim armies defeated the muslims
and it is islam's preoccupation with violent victory rather than persuasion that makes it globally hated
the very definition of islam is hatred and negativity we have to get rid of that cancer so civilization can advance
my opinions of islam don't come from the media they come from the quran and hadiths
in the quran islam declared war on all mankind years ago it is time for humanity to return the favor
islam is not a race microbrain it is a death cult
no just muslims having more babies as their prophet told them to do for the sake of population imperialism
your people's struggle is to dominate other people through violence so fuck you
no israel is containing muslim violence through the only thing muslims respond to violence
and in the meantime the palestinian fuckers are beheading gays and doing honor killings
no the muslims murdered the jews the traditional muslim way with swords knives and spears and they did it for years
who's them i only see real beheadings in palestine and the rest of the muslim world
virtually all the women being beaten and tortured in the world are getting it from muslims
the racist are muslims who use breeding for population imperialism
if they were aligned with neo nazis the muslims would love them
kind of like the islamic world is a prison
lol with conspiracy theories like that are you sure that you aren't a madrassa graduate
rofl jews used to live on of arabian peninsula who is committing genocide against who
muslims are trying hard to finish the job of genocide that their prophet mohammed gave them
israel withdrew gaza evidently is so far up your ass you're choking
but your child raping prophet made his intentions clearly known in the hadiths
yeap leave it to a muslim to consider stoning women to death as funny
bullshit they are prisoners in their homes and in their country
here is my twitter page islamolunatic
islam = nazism how could it be reformed
these muslims are babies are trained to kill scum
because they use their women as baby machines and they practice population imperialism as commanded by mohammed
i dont have to live there to know you can't leave house without male relative
i know you have religious police telling how to dress
i know that men can and do marry babies in saudi
if you walked down saudi street dressed like in yr picture would be arrested
i know that your husband can beat you there and there is nothing you can do
nobody on the supreme court had a clue about what a murdering raping bigoted pedophile he was
like a bunch of mindless bots muslims repeat the same lies in exactly the same words every day multiple times a day
where is your evidence that they are furious goat fucker
nobody said that goat fucker you made it up
any fool can see that is a photoshop job goat fucker
blumenthal's silence on muslim bigotry and it's cost
that tiny group is dripping cluelessness all over the floor oh please love me for my brainwashed anti-semitism
look at this ranting lunatic palestinian interesting what he tells us
palestinians are half egyptian and half saudi palestinians are the spearhead for the arabs against the jews
nothing has any value for arabs except the destruction of the jews and the arabs must pay palestine to destroy em
the filth of the palestinian head choppers and honor killers and genocidal maniacs is there for the world to see
hey at least he doesn't murder people for apostacy and blasphemy like your tribe of scum
your proph beheaded jewish men amp sold the women and children into slavery and you love him
so asshole muslims reserve the right to act like animals and scream like women when other do it
compare a netanyahu speech to this genocidal palestinian lunatic
the english amp israel were really thinking ahead when they sent baghdadi to all those islamic religious schools
isis is a giant embarrassment to muslims not just because of the barbaric things they do but because
the prophet mohammed did the same thing baghdadi can quote quran and hadiths for every action he takes
so of course muslims are caught in a corner having to make conspiracy theories to try to protect islam
but look at the reality disconnect burak says he is for freedom and against all slavery while at the
same time admiring the ottoman state which was a total authoritarian slave state
while the palestinian terrorists that blumenthal loves are throwing their opponents off rooftops and really beheading gays
by all means send the muslims back to the middle east before they turn europe into the same sewer
with muslims attacking european jews and grooming european children get rid of them
want to see totally insane rantings look at bloomenthal's terrorist friends
no it doesn't suggest that islamolunatics and left wing lunatics suggest that
no now we have idiots like you claiming that the muslims should be allowed to finish exterminating me jews
as this palestinian makes clear they are egyptians and saudis and that arabs must destroy jews
wrong again islam = nazism and muslim murderers have exterminated jews
and the muslim nazis left the jews nothing but this
the jews lived on of the arabian penninsula before the pedophile prophet started to murder them
in fact the pedophile prophet clearly stated his intention in hadiths
now the muslim arabs are using the palestinans as their spear point to complete the extermination
blumenthal self promotion the only groups that attack talks and kill people are max's terrorist muslim friends
shows how stupid you've become only muslim terrorists actually attack talks
neo-nazis and holocaust deniers adore because he thinks just like them more
norm only got the book wrong it should say quran since muslims have been doing that for centuries
raping year old girls is allowed in islam so where are child soldiers outlawed
and hamas trains child soldiers and sends them to get killed for propaganda
because there are no zionist thugs just people protecting themselves from muslim head choppers
try sending the bible to some muslim lunatics saudi won't even allow it in the country more religious freedom in israel
of course muslim religious bigots like you think that is okay
it's nothing compared to muslim pakistani mobs murdering christians and hindus on fake blasphemy
so the entire nation of saudi should be punnished since they don't allow churches or bibles
that's because the standard of comparison is to murdering muslims
they are occupied because arab muslims want jews exterminated
why when he could be elected mayor of peshwar in a heartbeat he could then murder christians for blasphemy
what black and white terrorist scum there is zero evidence presented are you a madrassa graduate
i think your goat is calling you she is horny
you must be one of putin's army of paid internet trolls
if you're surprised to learn israel-haters and are promoting a vicious anti-semite you aren't pa
there was no shujaiya massacre the place was full of blumenthal's terrorist friends and their weapons
the arabian peninsula was once full of jews and christians they were decimated by the muslims max is helping them finish it
the difference is that he only said it the muslims are doing it
then why have all the jews completely perished from much of the arabian p when they once had of it
if you want to understand the lie of muslims living in peace with jews read ibn warraq
no shithead they were killed or forced to convert mohammed started the ball rolling by beheading jewish prisoners
and then the pedophile sold all the women and children into slavery and he is the model for hamas and isis
not only them mohammed ejected the other jewish tribes from medina and later slaughtered them at khybar
it is an obvious fact that most jews lived in ghettoes under the bigoted muslims
the first crusades were by the muslims microbrain when they invaded europe and plundered all the way to central france
if the muslims had not been defeated by charles martel civilization would be a millenium less advanced
and we would all be worshiping the god of terrorism
the jews were murdered for years by rampaging muslim mobs in spain n africa and the me
today christians are still murdered by rampaging muslim mobs in pakistan and egypt
who cares who defined it the muslims lived off the production of the jews and left them impoverished
in fact mohammed and his thugs were starving before they captured khybar stole the jews property and made them pay to live
the holocaust happened in india where the muslim scum murdered million hindus and in africa where they murdered mil
another line of horseshit the poor muslims being attacked but virtually all their attacks were offensive
mohammed led major military expedition and murdered amp raped and enslaved tens of thousands jesus buddha lao tse lead none
and we are suppose to believe that the murdering muslims defended themselves all the way to europe and india bullshit
again you are an idiot the muslims were thugs they quickly figured out that if they forced everyone to convert there
and this proved to be true when there was no one left to steal from in the saudi area they became broken down criminal places
the muslim societies that managed to survive were brutal slave societies where they lived off the labor of slaves and women
like the ottoman empire was a pure slave state
no asshole i single out muslims because their barbarity is set in stone in the quran and they have not and cannot evolve
jihad is the cornerstone it is a declaration of war on all humanity and it can only stop when islam is completely discarded
only an idiot that doesn't history would say that you have never studied the barbarity of the muslims during that entire time
womderful we are going to produce our own madrassa rat jihadis
what about the environmental experience by christians jews ezidis hindus etc in muslim countries racism
lol you think there are no probs for people who don't tow the main stream line in muslim c
palestine has never existed as a country before the jews it belonged to the ottomans
fighting for him would mean not forcing him to become a jihadi hate monster
yes i'm hoping we can get the muslims to stop oppressing jews and christians and hindus and buddhists
what do you read from her face terrorist
because the muslims have been exterminating jews for years and mohammed started he muslim hatred of jews
free them to do what cut off the heads of gays honor killings child marriage exterminate jews throw ppl off buildings
another race baiting idiot if it were about brown men i would hate hinduism and buddhism and tao but i only hate islam
there is a reason that there are over islamic terrorist groups and why no other religion has such a phenomena
mohammed owned slaves jesus did not mohammed robbed caravans jesus did not
mohammed raped women jesus did not mohammed had people murdered jesus did not
mohammed led major military expeditions that killed tens of thousands jesus led none
the crimes of islam far outdistance any imagined crimes of israel
the israelis are fighting not to become the minority victims that all other minorities are
every minority in every muslim country is a shrinking minority due to muslim abuse
but the population in palestine is still blowing up no muslim abuse is the worst
most countries are moving in that direction but not muslim ones
well idiot i see that every native minority in every muslim country is a shrinking minority due to muslim persecution
and maybe you are to stupid to see that the muslim terrorist in palestine murder more civilians that israel
the reason that there are still muslims and not jews and christians is due to muslim brutality
somewhere in the world muslims are at war with jews christians hindus buddhists taoists atheists and anamists
all of islam is blinded by hatred the religion was built on hatred and intimidation
i call that one thousands of the number of people muslims murder every day
no the muslims worldwide are the problem israel is protecting itself against the same muslim persecution that is global
in every christian nation you can say what you want about christians amp jesus muslims kill for blasphemy
it's not just a few muslims it's more than half
the murdering muslim blasphemy mobs of pakistan
in what way is blumenthal jewish other than by birth answer the question
exactly he's not jewish by choice or allegiance amp i bet he doesn't go t synagog he only reads torah for faults
the majority have radical and violent opinions when they are polled about them
million muslims are extremists
a muslim woman talks about sex slaves while max panders to them
christians and hindus murdered for blasphemy by muslim mobs
i have three qurans and the only few peaceful verses were later abrogated by dozens of violent verses
that is a lot of disinformation for example there were never more than million north american indians
already proven that islam abuses women amp i showed statistics to back it up i'm bored with repetition
what about muslim blasphemy laws they lead to lynch mob murder let's stick to important stuff
many of the isis members are walking stoners even it's been rumored he's high on http
i think daesh are rejected because they are an embarrassment but they follow the quran and sunnah to the letter
in fact many muslim countries have the same odious laws as daesh this shows sex slaves are approved in ksa
it's not it's sex slavery is permitted in many muslim countries here is the proof
bloodthirsty muslims flock to isis' theatre that loop jihadi atrocities they enjoy watching http
so they blow up statues and churches and attack civilians because it's all they can do as they die in their rage
and you can only get highly educated people out of a free modern society not a th century one based on superstition
quoting from the book of violent fairy tales again
there isn't even a remote comparison between abu grahib and those images and what happens in those images represents islam
in fact all the things that isis does are the things that the prophet mohammed did in the past
racist blacks have shot two police officers and a year old in
about of iraqi civilians are killed by muslims
and if you are going to follow a prophet that approved of collateral damage then don't complain about collateral damage
no it's obvious that who is the target of the weapon that is the issue killing terrorists with any kind of weapon is good
if you don't like hate then you will have to rewrite half of the quran
another taqiyya liar making up garbage for the sake of mohammed's desire to exterminate jews
odeh's actions in the us proves that she is a lying criminal and so undoubtedly lied about what happened in isr
if you want t plumb the depth of hamas virulent just read the quran where it is spelled out in black amp white racism
good someone in the me has finally stood up to the muslim terrorists and their population imperialism
i pray that the lying criminal bitch goes to prison
the voted to prevent the muslims genocide of israel
most likely killed by muslims and i'm happy to see the israelis get back a small fraction of the land the muslims stole
the quran spells out global domination of humanity through jihad the torah has no such global aim
but islamolunatic live by islam and sharia trying to fulfill mohammed's wish to exterminate all jews from peninsula
those same genocidal muslims that practice their bigotry and barbarity against religious and ethnic minorities everywhere
and while all other religious groups globally are under genocidal attacks by muslims you blame the jews utterly stupid
no idiot zionism is the determination of jews to recover a small fraction of the land stolen from them by muslims
and the muslims want to destroy israel because they are racists not because of the land which is tiny
and of course you are campaigning for the destruction of the israelis because you are a racist anti-semite asshole
here are the verses from quran and hadith proving genocidal aim of the muslim biggots
here is a hamas palestinians are saudis and egyptians conducting religious war
and the problem is that iran is an extremist theocratic autocracy
not a real expansion just already existing local terrorists declaring loyalty to the worst of the worst
maybe you should teach that respect to the muslim hate mobs who murder christians and hindus for pretended blaspemy
maybe you should teach that respect to muslim assholes like these
by choosing to be muslims they have chosen to be haters of non muslims
and bibi is telling europen jews to move to israel so that they won't have to face the same muslim persecution as in europe
there is no land grabbing of the arabian peninsula should belong to the jews like it did before mohammed
your terminology is as meaningless as the assumptions you make from them palestinians have no country and never have had one
then you are a total idiot because muslims are killing people around the globe they are at war with every religion on earth
and the israelis are fighting no one except the muslim terrorist
palestinians don't deserve any more dignity and peace than they are willing to give and that is zero
no it's anti semitism this palestinian leader clearly tells you that it is a religious war by
arabs and muslims against the jews
themselves clearly tell you that their intentions are a bigoted racist holy war of extermination
it can't be separate while those wishing to destroy israel use it as a basis of their genocidal fanaticism
no more so than the muslims who consider their birthright to be global domination
i'm standing outside and looking in and there isn't a shadow of doubt that the muslims of palestine are the terrorists
muslim terrorists is the reason why the christian percentage of palestinians has fallen to almost zero
what race is islam nut case
hamas sympathizer pretends israel rejected truce to end blockade when hamas admitted hamas rejected it http
islam is a believe system based mainly on illusion overlooking gross barbarity is necessary
probably bcus only fools amp idiots take seriously the blame someone else for terrorism industry islam is to blame
i saw the report and i have seen other reports of shia crimes but i have not yet seen evidence of it for tikrit
the problem with the middle east is that there seem to be no good guys to support they are all islamolunatics
well baghdadi is also into slavery killing gays executing masses of ezidis etc they are both bad but baghdadi is the worst
why not your doing pr for a bunch of palestinian racist nazi head choppers
we are in an era where everyone has come to understand what the real is all about
article islamists on welfare paid to plot the west's demise
tell it to the million africans that islam murdered
mohammed approved in the quran of sex slavery isis is a firm believer in sex slavery
wants women to stay in their houses and cover themselves isis makes sure that they do
islam is a strong supporter of murdering non muslims isis is a strong supporter of murdering non muslims
mohammed declared a jihad against all non believers isis is executing a jihad against non believers
mohammed loved robbing caravans and looting for a living isis robs and lots for a living
mohammed was a pedophile who married a child isis marries many children
mohammed was a genocidal bigot who attacked jews and christians isis and hamas do exactly the same
mohammed was a sexist who abused women isis are all sexists and abuse women
imagine a muslim journalist making a case for why isis is not islamic no self interest there lol
what race are muslims poop for brains
mohammed stated clearly in the hadith that he wanted muslims to breed like rats so he could take over the world
the muslim palestinians have practically exterminated or driven off all the christian palestinians bozo
what christian who is not insane would want to live under sharia law
any idiot would know that the expelling of palestinians would not change the ratio of christians to muslims
one thing about muslims they want to exterminate everyone who is not a muslim they are doing it around the world
of course muslims are exterminating christians in egypt pakistan turkey etc why would it be different in palistine
no asshole the israelis are defending themselves against this
if israel had given palestinians the right to return they would now be suffering the same fate of all minorities under islam
your friends are the palestinians who cut off gays heads do honor killings force sharia
again idiot none of that changes the ratio of muslims to christians in palestine only muslim bigotry and abuse changes it
the prophet mohammed fired the starting gun for the extermination of jews and christians from peninsula
they didn't steal anything when israel was attacked by muslim armies they left instead of staying and fighting
when they left the israelis to be slaughtered they lost the land as they deserved
and as this moron palestinian clearly explains most of them are now egyptians and saudis and jordanians
load of bs their numbers fell steadily since then and you're still too stupid to see that doesn't change ratios
the prophet mohammed started the hate fest against jews by driving all three jewish tribes out of medina
with the third jewish tribe he beheaded all the men after they surrendered and sold all the women and children into slavery
today the hamas terrorists still call khybar khybar to the jews when fighting them
hard to get stupider than you still no change in ratios justified by anything israel did
and off course the fact that the same is happening to minority populations all over the me goes over your vacuous head
here butthead this gives a good summary of the muslim persecution of christians in palestine
hell t muslims are everywhere chanting death to everybody jews only have trouble with muslims muslims have trouble with everyone
what does that have to do with muslim extermination of jews
no microbrain i'm okay with israel doing what they have to do to stop the same extermination the muslims have done for yrs
yeap as a little propaganda nazi for terrorists you will reject everything that disproves your lies even thought the numbers
no the problem of the palestinians and all muslims is that they cannot stand for a jewish state to exist on the peninsula
what they tell you is their intention is not their intention
the holocaust was by nazis and the people who fought killed and stopped them where christian westerners
but no muslims stop any other muslims from carrying out their genocide they only aid and applaud them
years ago my ass that was the beginning and it has never stopped it is an ingrained part of islam
and the number of christians in israel is increasing while in all muslim countries it is shrinking
are you now going to play the ignorant argumentative asshole and pretend there is no arabian peninsula
good night asshole hope you get run over by a bus
yes isis defames islam by following it to the letter
terrorists that have taken the church over she was born an american and so was never subject to
her very actions are proof that she is a liar and a propagandist because if she did to hamas what
she does to the idf hamas would have put a bullet in her head long ago
it's great that you provided arraf's name now i understand how these anti semitic orgs function
all the lies they tell and the mantras they repeat about apartheid etc are all scripted propaganda and not spontaneous
and of course christians all over the world are oppressed daily by muslim bigotry
it's not israelis that are constantly murdering christians amp hindus for blasphemy in pakistan it's genocidal muslim mobs
yes muslim bigots are murdering christians all over africa and have been for decades
and muslims are murdering raping and forcefully converting christians in egypt and have been for centuries
and the muslim bigots have been attacking hindus and buddhists and atheists and anamists all over the world daily
apartheid is a propaganda word used by terrorist supporters to further the cause of muslim terrorism
the muslim mobs of bangladesh attack hindus destroying thousands of homes and temples
muslim mob violence against hindus in bangladesh continues in
christian churches looted and burned by muslim mobs
muslims are raping christian girls with impunity around the world
max blumenthal's muslim friends busy raping christian girls around the world
i think your muslim friends are raping girls around the world
no it's the absolute truth and you can verify it through hundreds of sources your anti semitism is scripted propaganda
has bloomenthal ever written about the endless attacks by his muslims on egyptian copts
has blumenthal ever written about ceaseless muslim violence against hindus in bangladesh
nope blumenthal ignores the countless cases of muslim violence against minorities around the world and instead
tries to make a case that the israelis protecting themselves against muslim bigotry are the ones to blame
kiss my ass i don't read books by muslim bigots written to promote their fascist murdering genocide of humanity
in fact blumenthal's palestinian friends behead gays
max asks as his palestinian friends are beheading gays doing honor killings driving palestinian christians out of existence
palestinians train the children to hate israelis and then us their confrontations for propaganda
which is why the joint blacks and muslims are murdering police in ferguson
so while thousands of churches temples synagogs have been destroyed by muslim biggots you only worry about one muslim
max looks at the genocide of ezidis and countless christians by his muslims friends and writes not a word
but who can blame him with his schedule of promoting anti semitism
putin has literally thousands of hired trolls working the internet to shape opinion with putin propaganda
filthy islam created them and is funding them
max's palestinian muslim friends throw an atheist blogger into prison for months for his religious views
why not muslims have practically exterminated every non muslim minority in mus countries
your goat is calling you terrorist she is horny
kkk is almost non existent but most muslims are terrorists
at least you're only a tiny bit racist rt i'm not racist but my dick is

the menus look like they were made by a year old little girl in this case just the mental age of a year old girl i
wish these blondes were in that how to get away with murder show
were butchers but can't tell red poultry is not cooked
not dumb blondes mmm perhaps just delusions of adequacy
stop saying dumb blondes with pretty faces as you need a pretty face to pull that off
the sassy foods feeling these girls are vile people
omg there restaurant looks like a a little girls room oh my gosh
my deconstructed tart joke from the last season of
ash found her inner bogun ewwww
nikki kermit the frog called and he wants his voice back
there's more moisture in those spatchcocks than the
the face of very ugly promo girls faces like cats arsehole excited to see them down tonight literally
elegant and beautiful cheap and trashy nothing more unattractive than girls banging on about how hot hey are
sorry but you are a long long way from refined
drasko only likes his mum's hot pot especially when she's drunk and unconscious
its melting because you didnt put it in the freezer before you served it you dumb skank
in the words of former contestant katie and nikki need to calm their farm
i cannot stop looking at nikki's dreadful black crooked bra
trying to find something pretty about these blonde idiots
i dislike kat more than the blondes who are going to tell us they're hot another times
i've had better looking shits than these two
hope one of those bitches falls over and breaks her leg
i can't even watch my kitchen rules without cringing at these girls
shit she knows how to walk you go girl one foot in front of the other
r u fucking kidding - catwalk - all that's missing is a pole
stick to your day jobs girls
obviously natural blondes
jus gonna say it again dumb bitch
wtf the girls used bought sorbet amd that was the standout shouldn't they be disqualified
it's katie and nikki to a t in that it's trashy and cheap
i will not be using killer blondes as a hash tag
shut up katie and nikki that is all
anyone else notice that all of katie and nikki's dishes were based on them being sluts sausage cock and tarts
wait that back shot of nikki in the kitchen she's wearing blue knickers honey no
everyone under estimated us umm bitch you came second last like literally just survived - you didn't win my god
who is writing the bimbolines
katie and nikki - nsw - my kitchen rules when will people learn they are not that hot pride always comes before a fall
my take nikki and katie should be the poster children for the obliviously mediocre
my god you can't use a can opener reminds me of a joke i know how do you know a blonde
kim kardashian has had marriages that didn't stretch as long as
sassy more like femme bots than killer blondes
how the f k are they models
the girls are bringing some sassy-ges to the table
they weren't kidding when they said deconstructed yeh seen better shit in women's magazi oh right sorry
katie and nikki have definitely proved they're not just dumb blondes with pretty faces they're just dumb blondes
who was responsible for convincing these girls they were so pretty
oh my gawd we are like so hot i can't even
did you find katie and nikki in the line for mt druitt's next top model
ugh these are killer boring and what's with spreading their dna all over the table unhygienic -and- gross
not to mention these same girls on have super inflated egos considering they didn't cook that well and aren't very nice
yes we get it you're pretty tone down the self promo and just cook
if i hear hot pretty sassy like us one more time i will deconstruct
nothing worse than a raw cock oh wait
guess one of em isn't too bad
our main course is going to be vacuous and narcissistic just like us
makeup time for katie amp nikki
that was annoying if she calls her own self pretty one more time i'm gonna vom
the girls are going through this is fucked or are they sucking colin's cock
these delusional narcissistic hostesses on make me want to vomit my own dinner up
the theme for their instant restaurant appears to be barbie's dream narcissism kitchen
the girls can cook for me anytime just not hot pot or spatchcock
if the vapid duo of conceit get through tonight i'm not watching again
they starting to act and look like a couple of b grade hookers to me
maybe the girls should have less tickets on themselves and worry about the cooking
out of the two blondes which one is beavis and which is butthead does it matter
those blond girls make me crazy they are so annoying
catching up with if society judges these two as pretty then i really have no friggin hope
if you talk the talk you gotta walk the walk do the girls know the recipe for humble pie
i think the pink has gone to the girls head
think these two girls have wayyy to many tickets kn themselves i think not
classy and elegant is one way of putting it
oh yeah colin smash those girls
kel the butcher has never heard of these silly sausages on
did stevie wonder choose these models
why do they keep saying that they are so pretty
is sexist then four of the six teams in the fourth instant restaurants are an all-female team
nikki amp katie is what happens when parents continually tell their kids you're a winner in my eyes amp avoid constructive feedback
anyone can cook from a can girls
we want everyone to know we are not just pretty faces noone said they were pretty though
why is their whole menu dick related
stop saying sass or i will put my foot up your ass
this is supposed to be a fucking cooking show not a bunch of faggots walking stupidly down a runway
you'd think in her downtime annie would have paid napolon perdis a visit and learnt not to use the same coloured blush as your hair
kim kardashian's husband will grow his dick back by the time this series finishes
what a riveting little lesson in walking the catwalk thanks ladies
the format to is stupid it'll be about weeks until we see the cowboy and his fit daughter cook again
the missus loves if i have to watch five more minutes of these stuck up idiotic bit hookers i'll neck myself
yeah colin would be looking for more fat in his sausage
deb better be there tonight or can fuck me hard with a rusty chainsaw and call it mary
really really another round those butcher promo girls better be nice to sheri and emilie yes or else
sauce capsicum and stock from a packet jar the quality of cooking i expected double standards from the 'promo girls'
will those killer blondes kill the whole dinner
aww i was looking forward to ash and camilla butting heads with the promo girls the drama would've been great
absolutely
sorry but on is being a real cunt you're not all that
so bummed the dull chicks on are using such a great name for their restaurant
my deconstructed tart joke from the last season of
just me or hot blondes on not at all hot just average
did she really just tell them that in order to walk you just 'put one foot in front of the other'
who was responsible for convincing these girls they were so pretty
did you find katie and nikki in the line for mt druitt's next top model
gosh i dislike those two girls they just aren't hot either
katie's a fatty model hahahaha
out of the two blondes which one is beavis and which is butthead
i've kind of missed annie's batshit crazy weirdness
y'all made one point more calm your tits
the blonde in red has breeders hips in that dress model my arse
these girls are acting like they put up three good dishes reality check use didn't get off that high horse
i want to see the butchered girls go up against the texan who has male sass and his daughter who is actually good looking
this is total bs - i don't know if i can stand anymore of the butchers of bimbo weaning off
katie and nikki may not be going home but still isn't that impressive i wouldn't be happy about that score you smart ass bitch
he saved them cause he wants to bang them
never met a promo girl that we wars a full length dress
it's obvious the blonde bimbos make better tv according to channel shit cooks
they're staying just so that the producers can have a showdown between them and the posh bitches
seeing as you two think this is a modelling competition and not a cooking competition i give you two a score of for your looks
do you get it you blondes
your sausage was a little bit short bet colin's been told that before
these girls should know skinny sausages are no fun at all
well ya standards are pretty low bitch
colin will save them they're pretty blondes as they keep telling us
unfortunately your sausage was a little bit short
i'm evil lol they are not models they hand out free crap in night clubs lol
i'd score the bimbos a for their instant restaurant just because their personalities suck
my kitchen rules or my vagina rules
katie and nikki nice from afar but far from nice
there's no real technique to the dishes being served up by these blonde bimbos on chuck together + hope for the best
that kitchen looks like they've re-enacted girls cup'
i've finally figured out what she models camel toes
i'm evil lol they are not models they hand out free crap in night clubs lol
ah girls you are dumb if you really believe you have pretty faces
we proved that we're not just pretty faces oh nikki you proved that when you first appeared on tv
correction katie and nikki are really the dumb blonde ones
we've proven we're not just dumb blondes and pretty faces true not just
dumb blondes with pretty faces well you got that half right girls
question is are they pretty
you've just proved that you are two blondes with fucked up faces
dumb blondes with pretty faces
more like
love a subtle menu sausage spatchcock tart perfect
who are the pretty girls these blonde scrubbers keep talking about
if it's rigged like every other year the nasty girls will get through for ratings
i was so hoping the girls were going to pull something out and they did a breast slightly unexpected
nikki has hot teeth
are you kidding me these girls on didn't cook their own tomatoes or peppers
just want to slap the stupid out of these bimbos
of all hearing loss is a result of sitting in a restaurant next to a table full of women who just received dessert
colin was pretty nice to the girls do you think he's giving them the dick
ffs a can opener is too technical for the skanky hoes
these girls are fucktards
nicki explains the complexities of catwalk modelling you have to place one foot in front of the other
i don't know what's bigger her forehead or her ass
i apologise on behalf of my generation for nikki and katie we aren't all so vapid
when i think lemon tart i think tart lemon yes colin i see what you did there
katie and nikki go down maybe not well but down none the less
it's a deconstructed tart like us
tarts for tarts
the only thing these promo girls are going be able to sell after this episode will be black hair dye not
i don't think any of those dishes had sas they were ugly just like the girls
so i take it katie is a plus size model right
the definitions of models and butchers are really loose nowadays
these chicks promo in porn 'fat girls need fucking too'
sassy more like trashy
i almost hope someone at the table mocks the because their deconstructed lemon tart looks like crap just like us
cock for main and extra tart for pudding think they're trying subliminal messaging
perhaps if the girls had spent less time looking in amp kissing mirrors and more time in preparation amp cooking they'd be better off
i don't think these girls can cook also pls stop the duck face
sassy more like trashy
promo girls what do they promo gloves and gumboots
hate these blonde bitches already
deconstructed tart by lazy tarts
this desert is a hot mess like its makers minus the hot
since when does the hill at the footy count as a catwalk isnt that what a promo girl is pimping out jim beam at the footy
how much can this blonde airhead twirl her hair
these girls say they're butchers i once worked at a boat hire shop so i must be a ship captain
just saw your tweet on these bimbos should go
hope the blonde cows don't make it through
yeah i can't see her sporting victoria's secret wings anytime soon
lol bitch please
and now for the dish that best represents the girls a big deconstructed tart
i didn't know they were models
its not the only thing she's done a lot of i'm guessing
the promo girls should be on cigarette packets smiling then everyone would quit
pretty sure that's how all the chicks walk at mt druitt westpoint
really bitch really get on the runway and back in the kitchen
zebra undies chic in pink dress
rt katie and nikki are frkn annoying stfu you're not even hot lol stop rt vid
when her hands get sore she finds another way to get the job done
these two take dumb blonde to a a new level
everything is deconstructed they're no good at erections then
they are really proving they are dumb blondes
yes you put in the wrong way cue dumb blonde jokes
omg i just knew they were dumb no common sense or brains
will this tart be the deconstructing of the girls
hahahahaha blonde moment
that kitchen looks like they've re-enacted girls cup'
jesus how dumb can you get
katie amp nikki's next job will be playing people who stuff up simple tasks on infomercials
there just horrible
tart lol
how is katie be a model when she could feed the table with her right arm
come on let's go party
put a bra on nikki you dumb slut
haha and that is all they are good at
these girls need to go their vanity is making me ill very unattractive
nikki's pouting is annoying me i'm ready to wipe it off and kick her off the show
deconstructed lemon tart because we're too bloody lazy and incompetent to do it properly
tart lol
bamboozled by a can opener and the sorbet churner for danis direct
nikki has massive
fat arms bad teeth and a massive arse what the hell is that katie a promo girl model of
everything is deconstructed they're no good at erections then
more egos and arrogance than that pink room can handle in tonight
i carnt see the pretty i think they quite ugly promo making out they'll go think it will be tony and lynne
nikki has massive
drasco u are not a chef just a wanka one day your misses will ask her self what the fuck am i doing with this dick
crumble curd and cream - a description of the girls' dessert but also their reaction to collin's inevitable scathing review
over the duck lips
that emma chick from is a total
and for dessert a dropped pie katie's face
don't overthink it girls just stick out a can of cool whip and a banana
and for dessert a dropped pie katie's face
lol - sausage cock and end it with a tart - best suited theme for these two
oh katie and nikki just because you're both bottle blondes that doesn't automatically make you pretty
i think drasco just offered colin an old fashioned wristy
the only thing funnier than an upside down ice cream maker insert when my brother's ex wife admitted to burning water
girls claiming they're hot generally have an overinflated view of themselves
these girls are either hand or feet models
katie is all sass
praying these two bloody bimbos will leave the comp in the next round
with a bit of luck nikki can do some promo work for a dentist and get some free whitening gel
big difference between sassy and trashy sorry girls you couldn't even work a can opener
these two need to be in the dictionary under gen y
katie's eyebrows are still terrible btw
oh katie and nikki just because you're both bottle blondes that doesn't automatically make you pretty
do you think the other teams are going to pick on the pretty girls tonight are there some other girls coming to dinner
who told these fucking girls they were hot
i wonder which of the blonde molls screwed colin to get that score probably both
so kat got a new decent hair cut then
i was sure they'd roll lynn out like violet beauregarde
the highest score in history better be not be the blondes or kat
you've lost yr credibility- for that junk main marking models soft after acting tough so long poor show
cos that's all they suck to get their jobs
drasko takes a peek out of the closet then bianca pushes him back in
i mean otherwise we would be on or the like fapping on about how sassily fantabulous we are
why do all these people want to cook for a living don't they realise it's another chore just more housework it's fun once or twice gt
everybody get a little greasy on
dumb blondes with pretty faces you're definitely right on one of those statements guess which one
according to holly from geordie shore sassy - halfway between slut and classy
steve drasko is the male equivalent of those faux models wannabe
you didn't give me a deconstructed lemon tart but have a anyway for the item that wasn't on the menu
look mum left right left right i'm a model no sweetie you're a promo girl here's your bikini go sell some shots
another fucking instant restaurant round fuck
promo girl katie calls her stuff spajacock and mascaronie never cooked before why has even picked them
according to holly from geordie shore sassy - halfway between slut and classy
cant believe the blonde bimboz made it through that sausage looked like feces
if those girls use the word sass one more time it does not mean what they think it means
and for being blonde i give you my inches hey colin what a bullshit menu and lack of talent
this colin guy is a tool how rigged is the scoring 's for main and dessert how ridiculous based on past scores
colin likes moist thighs preferably of the promo type
these girls really put the ass in sass
colin says the meat in the thigh was moist amp tender are you talking about the main dish or nicki's thighs
a suck on that whores
you in the red dress no just no and you in the pink si not much better
still moist and juicy let's take a selfie
katie amp nikki are atrocities but kat amp andre would be the ones leaving if they had scored the promoskanks fairly kat has no dignity
damn kat amp andre sneak through would much rather katie amp nikki had gotten through
best describes kat and andre
kat may be a bitch but let's be honest the blondes weren't too far behind
seriously nikki keep your arms down to hide the bingo wings and back flab eeee
stop smirking you vile bitch
omfg taste and swallow quote of the year
oh so the two dreadful critical human beings in reality tv can't cook to save a life kick these bimbos to the curb
i'm annoyed to have missed this live need some bitchy annoyed to have missed this live need some bitchy
if i could score them a zero then i would because i'm a super slut
cough slut cough
love debra and eva and sheri and emilie such beautiful souls will sheri and eva ever kiss
this will be my face when your nasally bogan head is banished from my tv
sheri if you don't swallow that fine but ill drink lots pineapple juice
neither girls can cook to save themselves nikki just wants her face on camera minutes of fame
go fuck yourself kat stupid slut
bullshit kat amp andre you are deadset cunts
yes kat and andre were unsportsmanlike but even if they scored or like everyone else the bimbos still wouldn't have got through
catching up on disgraceful behaviour from kat and andre strategic scoring won't save them forever
stfu kat ya bitch
annie looks like a mouse
go hot girls
jeans were a bit tight tonight andre
i was really hoping crazy bambi scored the butcher sluts a strategic
wtf kat and andre are cheaters that is so unfair they cannot give someone they should be gone
yup there still hot blondes
the major coincidence in the score that kat amp andre gave is that kat recently scored on her home iq test
karma will fuck you in the ass and cum all over back kat
middleinformer rt benpobjie credit to kat she puts a hell of a lot more effort into badmouthing others than she does her cooking
stick it up em kat you're the sort of bitch that really makes the show
if kat stays we can watch her descent into meth induced insanity
i hope these blonde girls make it thru not great cooks but they aren't as judgemental as that wa lady
in australia we have always had tall poppy syndrome since when did sabotage and bitchy behaviour get you on national tv
ahh manu well said just cook good food and you'll be ok simples back in ya box bitch kat
we're still two young hot blondes well you're young
i am so glad those annoying bitchy blonde thots got kicked off
cat you're an ugly and mean bitch you miss can go fuck yourself
manu - you're beautiful
why are the wa contestants always assholes yeas running
kat calls it strategic i call it being a biatch
following kat amp andre i would love annie amp lloyd to piss off they are almost as bad miss ray of sunshine is as fake as her
biggest flogs the show has ever had on it ever
the blondes will get through cause they are young and can suck hard
i think the hashtag got some traction
next week n new idea lloyd and drasko's secret sex romp
that judge whatever his name needs to stop the fake tan he is literally orange
omg the sluts are going to get through
lloyd likes some thick juicy pork poor annie
i have a stupid man crush on lloyd and i can't help it
the truth behind another elimination round to get rid of
borrowed time cant wait for you to get blown away by the decent teams
kat looks like medusa tbh + that ugly personality to top it off
get gordon ramsay on there he'll sort out
purposely pick slightly unattractive girls who're besotted with themselves makes good television lol
don't you dare put in the water works kat you're evil
why does kat always need to make big eyes you freak me out witch
kat the lives to fight on
kat is a fucking cunt
quit bitching - if kat and andre had scored a the blonde fuckwits would still have gone check out the other teams scoring
someone get kat a straight jacket the bitch needs some time in a padded room
can someone punch that smug smirk off kat's face please
this bitch has no right to talk about fair and has no right to celebrate i hope that they crash and burn they don't deserve to be
she should be practising on her cooking skills
the blondies eliminated feckkkk
kat might as well go home now since she has no chance of beating the other teams
this isn't even about the best cooking right now ugh i can't wait for things to get tougher so we can see kat and andre sweat
i want to slap that smirk off kat's face i know i know stand in line
kat and andre shouldn't be there they suck dick holes the moles win my vote with the burnt butter icecream
no wonder kat cant keep a job shes not good at anything
honestly some of the rougher female heads on tv are compiled right here
oh my god if kat stays in i quit life she doesnt deserve it so hard
it's either katie and nikki or kat and andre to go so as viewers we cannot lose or win
but there is still the dolly magazine model competition once a year girls
kat a massive c nt the biggest ever on
arghhhhh i want to kick in the television set right now kat you despicable rat
oh shit now we have to put up with freaking kat and no balls andre for another week fmd
gaaaaah i just want to slap her back to wa
i think it was nikki and katie's modesty that made them so appealing
so those blonde chicks are gone yayy
i'll say it if no one else will that kat needs serious medication
why does kat have too be such a cunt
unlike i can't wait to see you crash and burn
faaark the blonde promo girl walks with all the grace of a tradie in drag
kat is completely class less
we're still two young hot blondes who aren't really blonde and not that hot
to be honest i would rather have had those models stay
the promo bimbos are certainly annoying but kat and andre seem like truly objectionable people gross
is my kitchen rules about cooking or bitching seriously guys
was not a fan of the promo girls but kat is worse
get gordon ramsay on there he'll sort out
kat is the daughter of satan
no one even likes you kat amp andre you won't last long
two blondes twitter will be the judge of hot
fuck you and your strategic unfair voting don't like either team but at least they weren't c nts like kat and andre so disappointed
kat a massive c nt the biggest ever on
awww bless them they still think they were hot
ok so i'm not the biggest fan of the blondes but even i didn't want them to go

but there is still the dolly magazine model competition once a year girls
the promo bimbos are certainly annoying but kat and andre seem like truly objectionable people gross
how annoying is this kat on

shame katie and nikki kat - you're going down

sympathy levels rising we're still two hot blondes amp it's gone
ah feminism is still going strong at least we're still two young hot blondes

how long until kat heats up her crack pipe over the bbq think she already has crazy bitch
kat is busy warming up her crack pipe over the bbq stand clear

kat is a completely rank cow but by god annie is annoying but kat's way more annoying and unbearable then annie is
the elderly chinese gentleman hasn't heard of bubble amp squeak before and steps away from the insane red head squeaking at him

i wonder if kat will ask everyone if she can bum a durrie
kat's not a morning person or a midday person or an afternoon person or an evening person wait is she even a person
i need a drink or watching amp listening to kat just does my head in
celine does a good elephant she's obviously had practice
shut up kat
because gas bbqs are for wimps
kat's dealer obviously delivers
looks like shit not surprising
oh kat never mind
oh no another one of mullah oktar's mindless bimbos here to repeat what he told her to say
where does oktar find all of you bimbos to endlessly repeat his stupidity
sorry bitch you did your research in your own asshole
yeah bitch they did this
in the meantime the bitch looks right past the genocide of boko haram
you have to be extra stupid to be a woman and follow
she is lying

unless you compare women and men with same profession and experience you are just a sexist
and blumenthal fights for the abusers of women
hey bitch the reference numbers are right there go get a copy of the hadiths and look it up
what does your quran say bitch
it says women must stay at home and not display themselves
again skipping what you don't like it says that men are in charge of women and men are superior to women
and at the end it clearly states that beating women is an option if that's what it takes to make her obey
it doesn't say mentally beat them it says beat them you are sugar coating for the kiddies and women
being strong physically does not mean strong mentally the verse clearly says that a husband can force his will on a wife
so tells women to stay home and cover up
and tells women that men are superior and that husbands can beat wives
what is it that women lack that requires two women witnesses to replace one man

bet i can prove that you like most feminists oppose equality quickly a b or c
you won't answer like most feminists because the answer exposes your opposition to you fool only yourselves
you make many baseless assumptions and decide they are facts
nope jessi and many other feminist's love our male tears though
ftr i'm an era not mra term mra is flawed for same reason as feminism gender specificity

the wage gap is debunked lie and rainn says rape culture is fairy tale that distracts from stopping real rape
seems she did have plenty of time to deny evidence and arguments just no time to make them
ok whew that's good get a real degree and forget this poison of victimhood known as feminism
i keep trying to explain gop needs co to get to nominate a drug war-rior like romney and you lose co and the wh
not true feminism is also about getting free stuff and using benevolent sexism chivalry to their advantage
you support the slut shaming of odd
those women are not exploited they make a calculated choice to use sex to advance careers
no just listing two of the only degrees more useless than mine
i saw him but i rarely engage male fems zero point to it they are just following orders
works for huff post that's how they get jobs they hire the whitest knight
it's fine had the same argument s of times you will eventually argue abortion has zero to do w having a kid or not
just her body right
sounds a bit too much like separate but equal it's sexism bias bigotry you name it is clearly infested w bigots
a well done one must say fem i was arguing w had rt me a few times so i thought this was her cavalry
now it makes sense is all about being full of shit got it
watching feminists their lapdogs have conniptions amp mock a movement created solely to mock their movement = too funny

welcome to my stupid emotionally crippled child who needs to put their fingers in their ears cuz life is hard list

i am amused greatly by the redscarebot
if feminists knew how many women internalized my misogyny theyd need safe space

i know what a straw man is einstein what is the straw man here
i present exhibits v-z that
or the fugly
do you ever find it hard to take a seriously when it is designed by a hardcore sexist
so you oppose equal gender rights do you
so you don't plan on apologizing for your near-instant hypocrisy okay
this happens to men all the time men have no reproductive rights whatsoever
sorry for confusing me what am i looking at
oh snap here is what w from world countries think abt ppl like you http
everything i post is free to be reused
who said that
wrong and wrong
google financial abortion
proves a man can be sexist without trying but women can't even when they create a hashtag explicitly
not even close to accurate are you intentionally obtuse
is legit stupid or just trolling
no i can just see you are either a dullard or have no intent on listening so i refer you to google which you fail
it's still going strong but i will eventually devolve into pics of hot women pam or carmen etc
huh feminism is for fucking women sign me up
the college tribunals only apply if both attend that school
my twitter account is hilarious but i cannot take credit the mind numbingly moronic feminist hypocrites deserve the credit
you never googled financial abortion or you are too dumb to comprehend otherwise you would not ask what you did which
hard to say i naively had my fun not realizing the anvil above me i believe having that fun is key to later monogamy

how
is that wrong is forcing them into parenthood wrong
nope adoption and safe haven she is not bound
you need serious help gags i hope you find it
not arguing against abortion but for his choice too
get help seriously
thanks i appreciate that
hey how did you make that = = thing
when i ask them that verbatim question they call me an abusive misogynist you do you ever actually get an answer
please do sometime let me know in canada they just passed a bill led by feminists
why was she fired do you know
what does that figure represent how was it derived
are you a feminist
stupid got it
we found out quickly most of these questions were not looking for answers
you should be able to save from here right click or hold down on them and you should get a save option
do you view someone less reasonably if they openly declare hatred of your gender htt
yes am i a victim too
shhh it's a trap
has she been fired yet male writers for newspapers usually get fired for much less
do you think implying someone can't get laid is sexist or abusive
feminism
i derive the same meaning what have i missed
why can't you tell
these are mostly ignorant amp sexist do shitty things happen to you isn't your life perfect
can you give an example
hmmm that's a good point bathing in male tears is more of a feminist thing huh
oh
you sure
there is literally photo evidence above
why are denying and marginalizing his abuse
conversely is a good guy and egalitarian
so if he hit her in the same way for what she was wearing that would be ok too
i'll take that as you saying yes its ok for him to hit her in the same way
why are you body shaming her man hands
why can't shelters serve both
based on need not gender
men are attacked times more just fyi
this is the tag's founder
can you explain why this is wrong
i have no misogynist views feminism is an ideology not a gender fyi
with luck she'll be a stylist
can you comment on ford doing the very thing she complains of
i'm looking for them lot of hay on top of those needles
i didn't realize i was supposed to treat you as a child whose opinion is irrelevant sorry my bad
i'll take any screen grabs you have thanks
separate conversations she told a guy concerned about circumcision that he can't get laid exactly what she whined about
that is feminism's doing you realize
why do you judge on genitals rather than merit if a man works in an female workplace should he cry discrimination
no valid point i have never actually seen an mra say he hates women openly like etc
curious do you know what the pay gap figure refers to do you know how it was derived
no true scotsman
who are mislabeled
my god so it truly is a projection
as a result there is a possible supply of of the population for all female jobs vs maybe for some male jobs
women have more legal rights in every western nation who is privileged
so feminism is not about equal rights but a socio polital movement
way way more than one and why not that's how they arrive at male privilege
picture was gender neutral but sure
i never said men didn't have privileges or that women didn't face biases but its more than one way street
actually i have the same thing happens to african americans spanish and other minorities
yikes the feminists are getting dumber by the day
if paul elam said the same about women you'd be screeching about it
well i'd have no way of knowing general point
because fems aren't actually doing anything for oppressed women in the middle east
that was is in reply to her
what i learned from
good job having her call you a loser btw that hypocrisy is gold hopefully someone will see it
she's great
those two are the only self id'ed feminist i can think of who are legit
i actually wish they would just start using egalitarian so we can just let feminist mean the misandrist hypocrites
hmm which is the root cause of their hypocrisy you have swung me
picwhatting and you have quoted none of the tweets what are you trying to say
can you explain why what she described there is wrong
it is our individual listing numbers on a gamergate block list the sjw feminists created worn with pride
i meant this one can you explain why it's wrong sexist
handy guide for what to expect when participating in
i know of no places single men may in us some states do bar any single parents some only men
forgot already
he gets to legally decline parenthood during first weeks after conception more weeks for her after
kid not sure if should is really shouldn't etc
would rather
she will often not know it should be opt in not opt out so that he must be told or else they will hide it
not legally
every time i suggest it feminists insist they will so if deadline passes he should be stuck w o choice
so you will continue to oppose equality no matter the logic
me too it was going perfect got him on record when he thought it was just women before showing him truth
how about you unfollow me while you are at it feminists who follow get blocked i hate to block so plz unfollow thanks
we have bucookie
well i assume you saw my clem ford stuff no msm will write the truth about her maybe
is awesome if you don't know her write the truth about feminism
are you aware that feminism is teaching women that men cannot experience or discrimination ht sexism
my favorite when they argue to deny men choice they literally argue abortion is not a reproductive right
no i'm not a sexist
did you know that when you look at a girl - you rape her
pretzel logic is understatement is like a pretzel being beaten and tossed off the sears tower puddle logic
well i'd bet on the latter
feminist writer think valenti of au from what i know started the questionsformen huff po amp others wrote up
because if an obvious ga sports nut didn't that would explain it all
you don't regard ford as a problematic figure
so no issue with her doing the very thing she decries then
yeah my eye opener was a pay gap article i know a little about econ tried to explain why it was math not sexism but
i learned that doing so made me a misogynist
but not a joke a lot of her writing created the false rape culture crisis amp whose theories were drivers of new ca rape law
then what really opened my eyes an article on financial abortion even after reading i still opposed responsibility etc
until i saw prochoice feminists in comments using verbatim prolife arguments against men selfish jerk think of child
realized then that selfish hypocrisy is the crux of modern feminism not equality
well i checked out jessica valenti's twitter nice objectification of men and threats of violence
i'm blocked
people assume she saw my avi name amp blocked nope blocked by her before i knew who she was fems use a block list so
as soon as you follow enough known anti-feminists their block list activates and blocks you possible she is unaware of me
but the idea they want to do anything but lecture with dubious facts they don't want challenged is exposed by their blocking
yep pathetic let's examine idea anti fems just hate women do misogynists fight for their right to hate or just hate
like if really just hated women why bother with gg need no permission to hate they could just hate play games
is it wrong to argue by implying the other person cannot get laid
says an unthinking pussy yawn
there is literally nothing more creatively pathetic than taking an existing film and just making a black or female version
close up shop is just a roadblock in 's way at this point must be equal not gynocentric
hmm possible i don't read tabloids i just know he boxes another guy had one donald trump diva like right
but trump gets called a megalomaniac is that a gendered slur too i never hear women called megalomaniacs
exactly it's a sexist marketing ploy
not me either guns blazing or waiting quietly in my trojan horse
most democrats now avoid liberal like it's diseased stop propping up feminism w credit for the women's rights movement
allow word to evolve to it's current meaning selfish misandry and remove them from the movement so adults can work
no no this is my view on how to move equality forward must root out those who claim equality while working against it
make a new damn movie you hacks is my point
you have more legal rights than i do is that ok
don't know her sorry
nope
unrelated to highlander i also prefer fletch lives over the first for same reason as gb funnier bottom line
two of those three are already real
please identify the straw man dunce my sarcastic mocking hypothetical or those real examples
sooooo true
google christina hoff sommers wage gap or pay gap she uses real facts not anecdotes
eeuww i don't want to fit anything into their little boxes
column in questions coverage in view of my piece
if they had any shame or self awareness sure
is it lost on most was essentially ford's way of exempting her schlocky clickbait from criticism
yes and no a issue but banned as sexist when a feminist shirt would not be

an illinois pd studies nine years of their cases false
women who are actually charged convicted of it it's almost never prosecuted cops just close the case
google false rape accusation might work
never said men are smarter i said feminists are stupid most women are not feminists but answers i'll focus on
patriarchy is a myth so the system has no push back amp feminists use chivalry amp benevolent masterfully to own ends sexism
no question feminists have the media did you see any mention of clem fords open bigotry etc nope narrative is all
rock is much closer to socrates than most know
excuse me did you say that feminism is for everyone including men
yes your apathy
like i said a symbol is a symbol jewelry however can be pawned later
anything but yourself like every feminist on earth
a genuinely interesting question of course the answer is predictable and boring
how is that example sexism
in the film jennifer lopez plays a rapist that does not know what the iliad is and she's the protagonist
he was also just existing no
no
feminism would only have a name issue
yup
remember gaga what would you guess her iq to be
you linked to blasphemy
they are mostly borderlines yes w mucho npd mixed in amp lots of bipolarity
suspended here under a new acct stalked me for a day or so legit issues kid gloves on
unless it's at her pencil filled hands of course
i have about like that would be hilarious if she didn't need help so bad
and a few i like talking to even if i know they will be same as others when push comes to
both my desire to play video games is never stronger than after sex can finally focus on something other than sex
so feminists will trend and then complain how the fact is trending is proof of misogyny in society k
i saw this the other day excellent
just going to keep this here so i can direct fems to it when they want to argue my blog
ahem
i don't doubt other life but realistically don't think we'll see any evidence in any of our lifetimes so i don't think about it
but riley was hilarious on stern hadn't thought about him or the biovians in years
bitter geno
not what i'm looking at no
i am tennis neutral just setting up the joke
no name one men's right they fight for
oh my that is the trolling equivalent of a wmd a meme of mass destruction
i'll find a special occasion thanks
for what possible stated reason to slow men down to women's pace
this is what happens when you confer the dignity and respect of mlk and real civil rights leaders upon untreated borderlines nuts
to an extent we are not exactly overwhelmed with great options choices
you've seen the article by founder of now's sister right more and more i see feminism thru this prism
it's backdoor communism
have no answer there hillary is a horrifically flawed candidate but bush romney santorum huckabee choice of shot or stabbed
i'm dying
are you aware women have more not fewer legal rights than men
did you know feminists think that violence is okay so long as the victim isn't seriously injured
why ignore my question to deflect with yours are you aware men have less legal rights is that equality
let's test
it's close need one of those conan o'brien morphs of tony and the big hurt
so is the answer nothing
can you explain the wage gap what does the often cited figure reference
none of these things are true but i return to the original question research what have you read
where is your knowledge of feminism derived
single men cannot adopt
no one said she should
us canada uk france switzerland germany india every western nation and then some men have less legal rights equal
if it's her choice alone yes do you oppose single mothers
she can abort adopt it out safe haven
go back to the top of this thread and read again then
women r just as strong as men we r all equal wait men r stronger dont hit women we r weak
can you explain why that would be sexist
did you know rape is bad
agreed idea it's not a compliment absurd most important compliment
have you been told your pants are distraction to boys in school just our shirts
to obviously does not include brian banks whose life was nearly destroyed by false rape
ok w reasonable burping sneezing is involuntarily so moot can totally live w o inhaling others fecal particles
picture beaten but defiant picture beaten until the soul is dead
or grab a camera
feminist shirt never gets tossed but no shock fems own our schools
and i can't think of any good remakes period actually
the after all denotes sarcasm that you take out of context goebbels
proof
literally asking you to explain what you know the figure represents what does it compare
no actually she has an economics degree
wiki
is saying that sexism
how is that sexist
no i meant can you explain why telling a person you are arguing w they cannot get laid is wrong
wait do you realize you just did the very thing the tweet you posted said is wrong
the friendzone doesn't exist there is a women exploit you for your feelings zone
which tag are you referring to
u realize questionsformen existed before ford started posting snide crap in it right
i love this b c i am also a scientist working with men w more education amp experience yet i haven't experience
best not to engage with unpleasant people she can say that again
mt daily reminder that i don't care about straight cis jews's opinions on racism amp feminism
have u ever expressed ur anger only to be asked the question are you hormonal testerosterone yeah
have you ever been threatened with rape by a woman yes many times but only by feminist women
ever walked home in dark seen another person and becomed scared men are attacked times more often
ever play rambo on old nes by any chance
to be fair i read his you hate as your hate my bad working on worst sleep ever sorry
can you be legally forced into parental obligations can your genitals be cut at birth does your right to vote have an
mistake i find both abortion amp child abandonment detestable but if one gets an awful choice both must
think she meant would men who shed obligations also lose rights yes
have to pay if she knows he can walk way w o paying i think she might drive a bit safer i understand
many don't have the awareness to operate in what most know to be self interest they will defy most solutions
i agree ftr i am no fan of abortion or child abandonment but i can't accept him going to jail for not abiding her choice
hard to say w o knowing if avg welfare w o a dad is gt or lt avg cs payment if less it would reduce incentive
agreed thoughtful every once in a while an old tweet of mine lumping her poe in w gearheart is rt'ed i cringe
couldn't design a much poorer set of incentives no
well spoiler alert was actually pretty reasonable and i think accepting of the idea of choice men
i will totally pretend to be deaf at that point walk out like you're a ghost amp i'm bruce willis in the th sense
not being gay is not homophobia some do try to conflate them somehow
to some yeah
who said anything about hitting
oh missed that part of it no no reason to get physical
us is th best place for women behind rhwanda and ghana such bunk she'll never see it
i'm saying you can never control two different individuals to be the same
i liked a video from
can't relate have to be overtime of game of the stanley cup finals w no dvr
yep except the study the artist formerly known as mich something offered's author says it does not prove bias
a mf'ing state of the union invite
men are actually listened to and part of the dialog
k
nothing i like women in pink it's a tipoff that they don't angrily reject femininity like ahem well you know
no man buy pink and store it in their man caves just to mislead the market poor woman
join the party
i have a million valid arguments doesn't change reality
should men and women have equal legal rights yes or no
ok men have fewer legal rights in every western nation today get to work
saw this this morning
source
appears to refer to the idea that denial of visitation can be prosecuted under child abuse rather than specific laws
any real world examples of women actually being jailed for it
yeah but ur irrelevant amp relevant but old isolated fits the definition of the exception that proves the rule more than i find
rights mean nothing if they can be violated w no recourse
i'd like to focus on the plight of the beaver we are oppressed and i consider myself a victim
odd that google can find no relevant examples of it actually being enforced then huh
i keep screengrabs not links sorry google kate millett sister now it should be near top of list
hard to tell but i think that might have just been a troll
if someone hates you it's because of what's between your ears not what's between your legs
beware of con artists who co-opt feminism don't expect people who profit from a problem to sol
hope not how will she pay her bills
so is twat

awesome
best meme ever yours or where did you find it
ahem
real world evidence of this please
he's a gay known youtuber i saw his video unless he's brando it's real
you just said men don't need equality
should the default be equal
women have more legal rights than men
to racists
feminism
only times i'll block is if they spam or i think they'll try to janet me
pretty sure that episode of law and order is basically the new reefer madness holy actual fuck this exists
not doubting think feminist hypocrisy on ladies nights is a great example of their hypocrisy putting it out there
you mean it shouldn't be because it is consent to parenthood for men today
don't be the spoiled brat on the right
chemaly is a special kind of twit master of whining about rd world horrors to justify writing about things like
that didn't take much
this guy is an amazing writer regarding
how can feminists claim we don't have bodily autonomy like being able to kill your unborn kid is not enough for you
truth is has nothing against indie games we take issue with corrupt competitions though
no seriously went from fake dumb to oh god it's real to super fake to holy please tell me it's fake
sorry i genuinely have no idea real not best guess
i was sure it was fake until it went too long no one works that hard on a poe just vapid childish pc trash
scott walker should troll the left and get an online degree in gender studies
she was seriously right
thanks for heads up i watched it good stuff
no doubt but talk about projection first two sentences describe feminism perfectly no self awareness
and hillary pro-rapist
nope hence the two different terms
and whose definition is that anyway margaret sanger's
sorry just checked your tl i thought you were arguing in concert w this genius
sucking at math and logic is a requirement for feminism
i would never read see it so i have no idea what is the abuse they speak of
be sure to employ double standards to excuse your bigotry no one will notice
was sure it was poe but no one draws half a comic's worth of poe scary they are like termites
that's what i thought at first haven't read comics in a while so i have no reference awesome job if fake
usually takes to minutes for redscarebot
ok did she does she consent
ok my main interest is whether feminists will blame a book written by and read by women on men somehow
you too
who is to blame for that
not even slightly
shhh it's funnier when they don't know
don't worry nobody will notice your pet theory is ridiculous keep repeating it
yes and real shit
where is what from
for the first time ever i couldn't tell been wrong sure but i at least think i know at all it's evidently real
just a troll
i remember you praising a french feminist as being a good fem like chs what was her name again
for life yes
who is arguing that
it allows me to simultaneously engage in specific conversation while putting out ideas i'd have to redundantly repeat
it's not a negative or anti-you action
no i said that about feminism
again talking about feminists not you man
prison is the same except with more prison time
i remember respect your story but no convo was about feminists opposing common sense preventative measures
everyone here opposes rape male or female everyone here supports preventative measures it's all good
i am attacking feminist's character no one else's
learning some history will help you not take credit for things your movement didn't do

because they'd rather be sorry than safe
they use orwell as a playbook
not in the eu
never more patriotic than when i read people have gone to jail for free speech in supposedly democratic western nations
two people went to jail in the uk for criticizing feminists
only if you are unaware that feminism and the women's rights movement are not the same
you seem like a nice girl i just ask that u dig a little deeper into what feminism actually says does vs what they claim
hmm i think it's the jaw her head is kinda shaped like home plate to carry on the baseball motif
for knowingly retelling the wage gap myth amp myth plus blaming all men for rape via all to prop up hillary
the motive doesn't lessen the outcome
romney or jeb would be huge mistakes
romney's image better than ever due o but co will not vote for a drug war supporter like him and gop needs co to get to

but do they even interview the men if so about what
agreed i just hate that society is so economically illiterate they blame rather than capitalism for those questions sexism

i score them a and that's generous
the girls are gonna be pissed about that
i hate y'all
haha my little chickeny thing
if they had to walk up and down there steps to use the loo all night much effort
can't quite shake the feeling that is a tiny bit rigged since when do bullies add more value to a show
finally a meal without dracko piping up
really colin wth
i look at all these meals and wonder how many stopped for a hamburger afterwards
at least there are judging honestly
such a shame lyn and tony had to leave they didn't deserve it
those making it through to the next round colin has just lost all credibility in my eyes
i needed a dessert

these two are revolting
cream and crumbs on a plate work it gurls

double drool colin and manu

found this little gem on our way to
there is a secret element that weve decided to add to this dish thrush
are you upset about tonight's elimination result
catching up on did nikki amp katie get a script to say the things they are saying because i wouldn't be caught dead saying any of
the dessert looks terrible
that's just sloppy shit on a plate - deconstructed really - give it up for disaster
lemon tart looks like shit
has anyone made a twitter account for rob's hat yet
calling something 'deconstructed' doesn't make it refined
wtf am i watching
there's no way i can watch yet another round of instant restaurants switching off
that was useless from nikki
katie nikki and pete evans are everything that is wrong with society hard to argue with that
loving the tweets on the girls cooking on tonight
have the producers forgotten where kitchen headquarters is or something another instant restaurant round really
what is this shit
omg my dad and i are screaming at the tv
it's insane they keep bringing people back when will this show end
that does not look like a hot pot to me this has gotta be interesting
seriously not another instant restaurant round
cannot believe there is round of instant restaurants
is going to finish in september
- not sure but never fear still has teams left and another instant restaurant round to come
nooooooooooo no more instant resturants go away
night all enjoy
that ad is so old i'm wondering if the old digger is still alive lol
they could have cut and cooked their own capsicum e t c
colin are you having a lend for main and dessert little skill was demonstrated throughout
i'm sure that sausage on the hotpot looks more like a turd
is feeling a little rigged this year
nutrition is key to closing the life expectancy gap
please enjoy my deconstructed lemon tart
they barely cooked anything on that entre
i've seen soup kitchens that provide a higher quality of food seriously
all this endless instant restaurant rounds is making me develop the ddt's every time i touch a whisk
this show is officially fucked space cadets get to stay ffs
so i guess it's really happened the competition is running for eternity
ain't gonna lie think i might try pomegranate in a cous cous salad sounds yum
katie nikki and pete evans are everything that is wrong with society
can't wait to see who finally wins this competition in months
i really hope they get out-sassed
looks like it was an interesting night on
stuffing up instant couscous should be an immediate elimination
but nobody likes you amp tony
here is my deconstructed vanilla cake some assembly required
so this season of is going to finish in which decade such a drag
that cannot be their house no way
how is it sassy it's fucking spatchcock on cous cous
they weren't kidding when they said deconstructed
oh another trip around the country will they be cooking shark because this show just jumped one and maimed it beyond recognition
my housemate was inspired
are these girls out west or on the central coast
i thought this was my kitchen rule not my microwave rules
she'll turn just in time for next season of meaning she could apply for mkr father dtr duo
lots watching who are oblivious about where tin for their phones and computers come from ignorance is bliss
i hope history doesn't assume that gen y males are all like drasko
british lads will and steve are taking on the instant restaurant tonight and they're on now
things that take longer than the cricket world cup
another bloody instant restaurant week seriously they just jumped the shark riding two other sharks powered by shark power
really a can opener lol
okay they've brought it on themselves and i don't like them either but everyone needs to stop calling katie fat
you're a bit wet
if the judges didn't give their critique first the other contestants wouldn't know what to say they're just copying the judges
more comebacks than johnny farnham
you're just upset you aren't getting free feeds for the next three months
tonight overload
corsetry bloomers and hat pins will be back in fashion by the time this series ends
it is awful come dine with me because no one gets drunk on
here's a suggestion let's make manu and colin the main judges for the show
those blond girls make me crazy they are so annoying
this is fast becoming like that crap 's movie- neverending story more instant restaurants- aaaaargh
and so well have whittled down to in just a few short months knife fight in the car park would've been better
another instant restaurant round wtf
can't even make your own chicken stock
hashtag killerblondes is the dickiest hashtag in all history seriously why not
can understand that but the score seems so wack
those spatchcock are still alive
well thats lynn and tony screwed
lynn i would have scored them a
they can't be judged on the sorbet it wasn't on the menu yep i went there i just don't want lynn and tony to go home
just when they thought it was safe to go back into the kitchen instant restaurant redemption round
except it's not the best looking instant restaurant it looks like two year olds put it together
this season if you can cook with frozen food spice from a jar tin tomatoes jarred capsicum you will do well what happened to fresh
this shit show has more comebacks than johnny farnham ok back to the
i bet drasko loves a bit of spatchcock
new format is twenty teams in twenty years
lynne and tony are going home - they're too likeable
not so spatchcocky now
i don't see how they thought it was so hard wanna change that love
there wasn't enough lemon in your lemon tart other things there wasn't enough of an actual tart
gold rt i've been playing the sass word drinking game and i've managed to deconstruct myself
apart from ash and robert i'd pretty much forgotten about the rest of them
if we're lucky
i think i just threw up in my mouth a little
trapped in a pole-dancing venue with that hotch potch and sausage impersonating food
the bruce mcavaney of
if someone has to get the highest score in history it better be eva amp debra or sherie amp emilie
drasko steve and tennis coach bankrupt at the same table
star that declared bankruptcy amp hides money is an asshole i e christopher skase and his multimillionaire sons guilty
entree worth a max my kids cook better than this and they know how to open cans
that whole show is starting to look pretty damn good
twitter makes me laugh better than the series very funny
my daughter will be in university before this season of finishes
let it sink in that it's now march and we're still doing instant restaurants when's this season gonna finish
this is like that movie from the 's the never ending story
is there anything the dreaded draskco doesn't know
sounds good
the blonds talk about themselves too much they need to work harder in their cooking
if this horrendousness beats lynn and tony the angels i'll be so sad
i am nearly done with you a th instant restaurant round no three is too many as it is
we're not going to be de-boning this spatchcock the other teams may be expecting cooking skills but naaahhh
fark at this rate won't crown a winner until just get on with it
it's voil not walla
you are the best
no it's obvious the producers want some volatile action between the women for ratings
more instant restaurants i'm so fucking sick of instant restaurants
sigh oh colin
oh i knew it fuuuck more restaurants ok i said this is how the show should run but i've changed my mind
oh goody another surprise twist announcement said no one ever in the history of watching a reality tv show ever
heading into with another instant restaurant round
sassy girls rule

so who's out of
how can someone fuck up cous cous for fuck sake i can make that shit with my eyes closed
katie amp nikkie are pretty gutsy
another fucking round of instant restaurants ahhh i just want kitchen headquarters to start
oh kat and andre i forgot about those dickheads
i recall an article where prides itself on doing just season yr unlike m-chef's seasons obv'sly they're playing it out like
goodbye can't stand to watch those two words fail me again that was not cooking
don't get this dessert lol
this season's is going to finish in at this stage
yea i completely agree four rounds of instant restaurants is far too much probably won't tune in this week tbh
this show is going to air until christmas isn't it
i have eaten army food from tins that looked better than that and less like a dick
promo girls are going to bring it in the next round yeah bring it bring your store bought capsicums
drasko in looks unnervingly like crazy clay from tv show
i can't imagine how many more times we will see the same ads in another instant kitchen round i am now boycotting the products
the glasses guy is thoroughly annoying
it's not a surprise that there's another round they did it last time and the time before
what the fuck do you idiots think sass is
this show will end on dec but they'll spring another surprise round with the contestants great great great grandchildren
which will end first or tony abbott as pm
waiting for one of them to trip down the stairs
looking forward to the next round of restaurants
can't believe there is another round of instant restaurants but i really sheri amp emilie my fave team gets through
hmm confused sassy
that's where dave a former contestant lives now hey
of course they were happy with it they're happy with themselves full stop
best part of tonight's drasco vs steve war of the chef wannabes
at this rate the mkr final will be in december
bloody hell another round of instant restaurants stop draining it channel
we took people on a journey to a special place shouldve stuck to that instead of this cooking bullshit
are you serious they're going around again we might move past the instant restaurants by june
at this rate maybe they'll all be rocking up to my house soon expecting a meal - surprise round
basically the twists are a series of annoying ways to extend this season
we are losing our mum and dad well don't cry about it when bruce wayne lost his parents he became batman
and boom i'm officially turned off someone wake me when it's all over
soz my kitchen rules i've lost interest the instants restaurants are boring as anything times let alone

lynn and tony you've got no change say goodbye now
and dazzling white lights in his gob
current highest score ever on is helena and vicki in last year and nick and rocco in they both scored
oh just you wait nick just you wait the end of this episode will change how you view forever
these bottom feeders go up against another secret round of secret instant restaurants with secret food they have to cook blind with
wow four rounds of instant restaurants they know people will tune out when the second phase begins how long will this go
giving the loser teams enough time to cook everything well amp beat the score record i expect scores over
really really another round those butcher promo girls better be nice to sheri and emilie
were butchers but can't tell red poultry is not cooked
not dumb blondes mmm perhaps just delusions of adequacy
at the end of this steve is going to run away to mexico and go into witness protection
omg there restaurant looks like a a little girls room oh my gosh
ewwww
after that knockout round this is how many teams are left on my kitchen rules
stfu drasko
are you upset about tonight's elimination result
sorry but you are a long long way from refined
drasko only likes his mum's hot pot especially when she's drunk and unconscious
trying to find something pretty about these blonde idiots
they have no shame
i can't even watch my kitchen rules without cringing at these girls
what is this shit
oh no
stick to your day jobs girls
colin are you having a lend for main and dessert little skill was demonstrated throughout
so drasko just said he was impressed the girls cooked half a chicken they cooked a whole one
wtf the girls used bought sorbet amd that was the standout shouldn't they be disqualified
is feeling a little rigged this year
they say they liked the mains but they haven't eaten anything on their plates
i will not be using killer blondes as a hash tag
katie and nikki
so i guess it's really happened the competition is running for eternity
katie nikki and pete evans are everything that is wrong with society
i hate these girls far out
stuffing up instant couscous should be an immediate elimination
instant restaurant round
drasko they didn't cook half a bird you idiot
here is my deconstructed vanilla cake some assembly required
my take nikki and katie should be the poster children for the obliviously mediocre
so this season of is going to finish in which decade such a drag
how the f k are they models
the girls are bringing some sassy-ges to the table
my housemate was inspired
tonight's dessert is called remains of the day
also leave the eliminated contestants weight out of it what did they ever do to you how does their weight affect your life
hopefully someone cooks drasko in the next ep of
just read the get through switching off
amp tony
more comebacks than johnny farnham
corsetry bloomers and hat pins will be back in fashion by the time this series ends
here's a suggestion let's make manu and colin the main judges for the show
my little lemon tarts
those blond girls make me crazy they are so annoying
this is fast becoming like that crap 's movie- neverending story more instant restaurants- aaaaargh
another instant restaurant round wtf
hashtag killerblondes is the dickiest hashtag in all history seriously why not
maybe you girls should go back to cutting up cows and pigs don't quit your day job
nothing worse than a raw cock oh wait
guess one of em isn't too bad
to all you people saying nooo dragging on there's teams an weeks after these instant restaraunts it's only more months
i wouldn't want to deconstruct my lemon tart
these delusional narcissistic hostesses on make me want to vomit my own dinner up
lynn i would have scored them a
ugh these are killer boring and what's with spreading their dna all over the table unhygienic -and- gross
these girls are pretty awful
just when they thought it was safe to go back into the kitchen instant restaurant redemption round
except it's not the best looking instant restaurant it looks like two year olds put it together
if the vapid duo of conceit get through tonight i'm not watching again
lynne and tony are going home - they're too likeable
there wasn't enough lemon in your lemon tart other things there wasn't enough of an actual tart
if i hear hot pretty sassy like us one more time i will deconstruct
our main course is going to be vacuous and narcissistic just like us
trapped in a pole-dancing venue with that hotch potch and sausage impersonating food
you know kudos to for being able to stretch out a show over a month onto the show and we still dont have final teams
if you talk the talk you gotta walk the walk do the girls know the recipe for humble pie
this is like that movie from the 's the never ending story
when you're on show don't start making up dishes girls
fark at this rate won't crown a winner until just get on with it
if only this sasquatch had wings to help these girls fly out of the whole they've dug for themselves
classy and elegant is one way of putting it
oh i knew it fuuuck more restaurants ok i said this is how the show should run but i've changed my mind
kel the butcher has never heard of these silly sausages on
oh goody another surprise twist announcement said no one ever in the history of watching a reality tv show ever
heading into with another instant restaurant round
why do they keep saying that they are so pretty
seems the entire afl season will be shorter than
how can someone fuck up cous cous for fuck sake i can make that shit with my eyes closed
is sexist then four of the six teams in the fourth instant restaurants are an all-female team
this show is going to air until christmas isn't it
i have eaten army food from tins that looked better than that and less like a dick
i don't think there's anything more ugly than announcing how pretty you are over and over again
anyone can cook from a can girls
yes rt are you upset about tonight's elimination result
shutup about the sass amp read some cookery books you twit
why is their whole menu dick related
stop saying sass or i will put my foot up your ass

the format to is stupid it'll be about weeks until we see the cowboy and his fit daughter cook again
agree i lose interest after instant restaurants think they're cashing in on that fact this year
yeah colin would be looking for more fat in his sausage
i don't think there's anything more ugly than announcing how pretty you are over and over again
has become a steve v drasko showdown who can talk more talk
we are losing our mum and dad well don't cry about it when bruce wayne lost his parents he became batman
another round of instant restaurants are you serious yawn
i'm thinking will go past christmas eve and get into at this rate

sauce capsicum and stock from a packet jar the quality of cooking i expected double standards from the 'promo girls'
kim kardashian has had marriages that didn't stretch as long as

absolutely
it would of been funnier if those two bottom teams just got eliminated haha
personally think only one team should go through they'll be cooking christmas lunch in the finale the way this is shaping up
a redemption round this is too much
de-constructed is code word for 'fell on the floor' right
fuck do we have to suffer annie and lloyd again fuuuuuck
oh this round should be a feast of terrible food excellent
the format to is stupid it'll be about weeks until we see the cowboy and his fit daughter cook again

bloody hell how many more times can we see these people cook at home
another round of instant restaurants get to the good stuff already
ok i'm out i can't sit through another round with the worst of the worst

oh no we are not surprised
anything deconstructed should be banned unless it's a shandy amp i can give the lemonade to my niece
a from lynn and tony well we all know who's strategic voting
bring out the other teams i barely remember the second group let alone the first
i just remembered i don't really like many of them
annies back
everyone underestimated us we still do as well as underestimating the judging
the poodle is back
there's so much sass i can't even
way too many teams
i believe another nice irish expression would be colin is a fecking eejit
and a for smear of lemon tart
oh ders robert hey there
rigged
the poodle returns
yay robert and lynzey and sheri and emilie are back
haha girls it's not over yet
you've got big hearts colin i believe what you're meant to say was that they have enlarged clogged hearts

one of the girls looks a bit like claire danes
aaaawwwwwww how i've missed annie she always makes me smile
you lost me i can't stand watching those conceited idiots any more
for the dessert are you kidding me wtf is going on
surley not another round of instant restaurants
my cheeks hurt from cringing at the on
the hunger games
oh rob your hat fark it off
hope you do okay xd looks like youll do good darn i want a lemon tart now
aww so sad goodbye lynn amp tony wish you made it through don't give up your amazing and so lovely
wow that wasn't stiff or scripted at all such witty banter between the real chefs
omg colin's been drinking the coolaid
i was sure they'd roll lynn out like violet beauregarde
there still trying to figure out if is more than or not
drasko is a ridiculous name and his personality follows suit
people don't like surprises but they're on a reality show irony
no honey you can't win this competition
so many people this is going to go on forever isn't it
they shouldn't keep shitty people in a cooking competition for ratings how about you focus on people who can actually cook
i'm thinking there is another round of instants coming
is there going to be a th group
ash is back
emma we need to talk about that dress
they got through pity the blonde butchers lyn and tony nice ppl have left
don't get ahead of yourselves you've only proved you're not the worst
how do you give a for a lemonless lemon tart
of course they're going to stay we hate them therefore they're a ratings winner
boonch
wooo hooo ash and camilla are back
kate and nikki meet sherie and emilie class elegance and humility
no girls you really really can't win this competition
it was rigged
rigged so so bloody rigged
katie and her head wiggle reminds me of quagmire
lousy scoring colin it wasn't a mascapone sorbet dish it was lemon tart
that was definitely rigged
oh yay i am so glad i get to see more of these sass girls
can someone explain to the gals 'sass' is not the same as edible food
you've known them a fkn week
a for that dessert colin has just lost all credibility
hey colin you're a knob
then again no more animal print fisherman's pants so win
just put them all in a ring give them some boxing gloves and watch it all play out from there
yessssss
how do you give a for a lemonless lemon tart
how can they be ur a mum and dad after days at a dinner table honestly
time to see these girls finally cook sink or swim sassy won't save you
are you kidding me colin how did that spew on a plate get a
did they drug colin's serving or
good thing deconstructed only happens in food imagine getting a deconstructed house
see you later lynne and tony- sending you our love good luck in the future
go on explode it will be the best thing on mkr tonight
that's bullshit colin and you know it
you did not come out with the sass let's just make that clear
how the fuck did they manage that
a this bloke is utterly demented
still doesn't change the fact that you are a pair of airheads
the show is rigged as a mf the afrikins ain't as good viewing
that's crap lynn and tony should have stayed
damn this means j have to see more of their faces
colin is fucking high
this show is rigged
of course they're going to stay we hate them therefore they're a ratings winner
and a for smear of lemon tart
out come the fingers and toes to do the counting
open both doors please wide load coming
fuck you colin that was total shite
of course the dipshits stay
wtf
oh no they're staying
nooooooooooooo
officially lost any respect for collin that i had left
saved by the tail of a spatchcock
if they cooked like they would in africa then they would've been in i'll miss them
i hate deconstructed deserts you never even get anything it's like a fucking cheese platter
sounds awful but tony reminds me of mr creosote from the meaning of life
this is just ridiculous another ffs
fuck
for the main amp dessert what the
that's bullshit colin and you know it
booooooo ratings win aye
ya gots to sass it
handmade gnocchi for dinner frugii for dessert my home made dinner is better than that dinner
you have a tail
a for unboned spatchcock and instant couscous
the moment of truth did the girls deliver on their promises
bullshit
a colin dipping his end in
a this bloke is utterly demented
boy sure know how to dish out an insult your sausage was a little short of fat glad they weren't male contestants
de-constructed is code word for 'fell on the floor' right
preeetty easy to spot which houses are producer rentals
the sausage was a real letdown hey
the bord
the reason why katie amp nikki cooked the main was all in the name
've just been challenged to make this menu tomorrow night after commenting that's not hard i could do better than that
her leg was dry bahahahahahahaha
someone really wants to keep them in
we have hope but no cooking ability well that's a winning combo
fuck you colin
colin fully channeling edward scissorhands tonight
i hate when my sausage is scored a
there is nothing glamorous about that restaurant
joe is looking hopeful
just eat his dick already drasko
we have sass oh well a cooking competition is just the ticket
i've been playing the sass word drinking game and i've managed to deconstruct myself
apparently sass is what keeps you in the competition rather than the basic skill of cooking
collin admits that he is easily confused by a sausage
your hotpot was i don't know gross
'welcome to our instant restaurant tacky i mean sassy'
ad break pet pic not my tortoise tho i had them as a kid this is the cutest idea
if tony amp lynn are eliminated they should just burn the set like the house in what's eating gilbert grape
colin confused get out
three is a low score good work sherlock
ah the wages of being awful
aha but no one else does
makes much more sense when you realise it's not a cooking show
ok so i might be turning into my mother but isn't it a bit rude to wear your hat at the table
colin make moine a dooble
it must wonderful to live in a delusional surreal world where everything evolves around you
can someone explain to the gals 'sass' is not the same as edible food
shoulda named the restraunt
love how u have to where the same stuff on a different night
after the i'm actually hoping that lyn and tony go home
what does she model something to do with ducks
think the girls will easily get through
nikki does not look happy with the group's score
the show is about cooking not sass
'pretty good dishes we're happy with' - ok well i'm never eating at your place
but would they cook better than these terrible contestants
if i hear the word sass one more time gt gt
pete would love it
katie and nikki should've called their restaurant conceited not sassy
show changes its name to your kitchen my rules
if tony amp lynn are eliminated they should just burn the set like the house in what's eating gilbert grape
damn he liked it
stop saying sass
we have hope but no cooking ability well that's a winning combo
was that just the girls voices on they add confirming that they didn't go home really again channel
sass will not keep you in the competition
oh it's sas that keeps them in the competition i thought it was cooking silly me
rt surprise announcement another bloody instant restaurant round
runway boxes put together by the looks of it
ok who should stay and who should go
meanwhile the week one contestants have married divorced bought and sold houses
surprise announcement drasko is actually superman been dressed as clark kent for the whole show
i got it they're bringing the slam dunk contest to
katie amp nikki from are on tomorrow we want to find some more sexy butchers know any
maybe there will be yet another secret round where colin cooks off against pete amp manu amp the winner is declared the bigger dickhead
or maybe the surprise twist is ash beating nikki with a stiletto i'd watch that
i want colin and manu to just feed me
that would also be aces on a turtle in water
dying for the night when the special announcement involves the remaining teams eating the eliminated contestants
is love is life
well done for not spoiling the big surprise announcement this week
katie and nikki better not get a point for every time they said 'we're pretty'
hope the suprise isn't eliminated contestants get to cook off for a chance to return
oh fuck im late i missed stupid shit im sure
i hope colin doesn't like it
raining tens more like raining bullshit because we all know no one can bloody cook
in other news the team i was rooting for last year just favourited my tweet i'm not crying you are
pretty adjective attractive in a delicate way without being truly beautiful a pretty little girl with an engaging grin um no
we're off to a special location for this announcement it's a warehouse with drapes and a stage it screams 'special'
it's vs serengeti at sunset on
holy crap they just wasted mins of prep time getting ready and still look the same i hope their fall is spectacular
is taking us for a ride back to back as breaks
another surprise twist announcement probably going to make everyone do another home cooking round because no one can cook
i'm guessing a total of for the sassy ones and the south africans will be gonnnnne as they should
hen party almost over - when is pete evans going to jump out of a cake
the scores will not be revealed here everyone acts surprised yeah like you don't all know how it goes
if katie and nikki scored a point for every time they called them selves pretty they would score around
have a feeling the girls will stay just
no matter who goes home everyone is a winner for having to have dinner with drasko on multiple occasions
i think someone just pressed the wrong button
another ad seriously
and the next surprise announcement the losers will all transition to
ad break pet pic not my tortoise tho i had them as a kid this is the cutest idea
their restaurant name should be tacky not sassy
lynn and tony being so strategic and gave a i think i'll give them a
so if needed this secret round cos they realised no one from the first could actually cook will there be a double-secret round
why do they always look shocked when they reveal that the final team's score will be revealed at head quarters it happens every year
not convinced the on are all that or at least not what they talk themselves up to be here's the test
skippy was not served up alleged deconstructed lemon tart in this photo
another ad seriously
next surprise will be there is a second secret round taking place on mars by the guys that are applying to go die on mars
serve raw
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh the lip prints on the mirror so unhygienic these two are the wooooooorst
to be fair to katie amp nikki the combined group score is way too low compared to what they served up
surprise announcement another bloody instant restaurant round
omg a secret location
if the surprise announcement is another group of contestants i'm done
discussion of the lemon kurd adding nuance to the middle east debate on
look if the girls stay they won't win the comp anyway so i dunno dun care
aw there's nothing to cry about lynn xx
someone is going home absolutely it's in the production notes and is the premise of elimination round
from me below average all over
i really think you owe us your viewers an apology this is a cooking show - right
i have absolutely no idea what the phrase saving room for dessert means
we've proved we're not just the dumb blondes with pretty faces whatevs
oooh what do you think is the surprise announcement
hi ho back to the dungeon we go
'the chickeny thing' evict vote him off - what sort of idiot statement was that on a cooking show embarrassing to watch
tony and lynn wouldn't go so well on an old narrow tv
bye bye birdies
shock horror
how sassy is lemon the sassiest of citrus
oh shut your gob will its hardly a surprise
omg double elimination
so far deconstruction seems to also be happening on how abt constructing something
i want the blondes to meet the frizzy loud girl in the other group
drasco's doppelganger would be a more interesting conversationalist at a dinner party
i think a is more than adequate i don't want the sif ifrikans to go out
i'd push for a i'm secretly in love with you but not ready to come out i agree
i think it's going to go down really well bahahahahahahahahahaha wipes tears
spatchcock and couscous straight out of a cookbook
solid average
wait till you hear your scores butcher models
it's killing me
so have katie and nikki done enough to survive what do you think
lol the others have no knowledge about the promos
someone is going home absolutely well yes
you confuse me but in a good way
i haven't cringed this much since the work christmas party
my little chickeny thing was fantastic and you cook
i think you've been estimated enough
the spatchcock and desert looked great
i can't see how there was any real cooking in the main
it's nikki's hot pot but she has katie make the sausages
and double episode trumps
i agree with a will and steve
the teams are so rough in their scoring girls deserve better
obviously strategic voting
emma roberts
chickeny thing technical terminology here
refined amp pretty looks like something a blind kindergarten student chucked on a plate
you confuse me but in a good way
if a white person eats a dessert and no one is around to instagram it did it even happen
i actually wouldn't mind a bit of strategic voting against this team
colin is obviously malnourished from their cooking cause he sounds delirious
colin has the kid gloves on tonight they must be the producer's favourites they seem to like the dessert what about the micro-herbs
i haven't cringed this much since the work christmas party
i'm not saying tony amp lynn are definitely eliminated but the show has already booked a fork lift to take them home
the deconstructed lemon tart now being sold in flat pack from ikea
drasko trying to use his fork to eat the breadcrumbs
nobody likes a dry sausage
from what i can see there's a large gap between promo girl and model
what does colin and the rest of the table taste and see that we don't i thought murdered their instant restaurant
someone should deconstruct will
nikki kermit the frog called and he wants his voice back
beans on toast for dinner tonight would score higher than tonight's menu for sure
how do you actually eat that shit
i said i wanted sorbet now and they should tell us the menu prior but she's got an even better idea genius
they look raw how can they think that is cooked
am i watching punk'd
oh dear god this dining room
i'm happy when life hands me lemons can't do shots of tequila with artichokes
what do you think of dessert
not sure how much more of this crap i can endure
drasko and steve are trying to impress collin so bad
this is the kind of catwalk you see in penrith or parramatta westfield
would make my night if the two on failed miserably tonight they are awful
cannot wait for colin's opinion of this dessert
these people are seriously deluded to think they have any 'future in food' beyond eating it
gimme a break boys
i'm actually not too sure if i can last through this episode if they keep breaking out into a song dance and catwalk walk
the dessert has been forgotten about already
that just happened right the catwalk the cat-bloody-walk
people watch this shit fuck me dead
omg do you even plate
how embarrassing is right i would be embarrassed to be you two as well
but that's the thing they clearly have skills but waaaay monstrous egos as well
what a surprise mess on a plate
her laugh is horrendous
go girls
colin shampoo yr hairrrrr
lt lt lt as funny as a fart in an elevator they have treated this lemon tart worse than brandis did triggs
face palm face palm - the model show is cringy i watch for the cooking
i would punch the chef in the face if they served me a dessert that looked like that- hard
it's refined and it's pretty like us seriously someone get these girls english lessons they have no idea what they're saying
i wish people would stop deconstructing desserts
i'm amazed that could actually find a tweet of mine acceptable for television clearly there's not enough swearing
those that talk the most crap always end up doing bad
oh so pastry and kurd on the side
will reveals he once done some modelling as well as being a body double in a porno
yep they are just as pretty as that plate all the pieces are there just not put together properly
the afghan bowlers serve up better shit than this garbage on
does deconstructed lemon tart mean i could not be bothered to make the real one
the deconstructed lemon tart looks pretty much like what your plate might look like after you've eaten a lemon tart
they still haven't churned their sorbet
why would you serve this shit to colin honestly
deconstructed is a synonym for smears of mess on a plate
drasco is actually spelt drongo
why not just make a tart
oh well back to promo work
that drasko guy is really starting to get on my tits
deconstruction ruined the humanities must it kill food too
i don't get it why deconstruct a tart that's just weird
in what world would you not be disappointed with that
my dog has vomited better meals than that
turned on qld time to see your steve first mins of 'promo girls' amp i've poked out my eyes
massimo boturra is now crying bitter tears about their deconstructed lemon tart
i think the tweet picker is struggling
stop being so polite what the fuck is that shit you're serving us
the only thing getting butchered is their modelling careers
i will never understand the reasoning behind deconstructed desserts just make a lemon tart
colin is super hot
too funny this crumb is not shortcrust - it's biscuit
that queensland cunt in the hat reminds me of brian blessed if he was the most boring man on planet earth
dessert is served
my prediction for tonight is fail
hopefully lynn and tony will survive this round and see them have a second chance the girls haven't shown us enough skill
awful obviously they don't have the skills to make a real lemon tart
well they butchered that desert
we won't feel gutted if lynne and tony beat you i want to beat you with a stick
katie nikki what a dirty habits can't stand the finger taste test hand on icecream i won't eat in your restaurant
junk on the plate and in katie's trunk
micro-herbs it definitely is deconstructed not a fan of lemon desserts they're always the last flavour of lolly i have left
yes the dish is refined nothing says refined like being too lazy to put a fucking tart together
omg that dessert is so deconstructed lol it looks so easy
is 'deconstructed' code for 'dogs breakfast'
deconstructed = bullshit
hehehe i love will
should have gone to specsavers
not how i was imagining the desert to look
a restaurant and a cookbook for twins helena and vikki
katie and nikki are the worst
will colin like the dessert
fuck your deconstructed
what is wrong with katie and nikki on vapid conceit that's what
so it's a deconstructed tart meaning just put everything on the plate in patches
this dessert looks i dunno i'm not feeling it
enjoy your sugary finger painting guests
pretty er no
this is cringeworthy
dessert's looking delicious ladies
dessert shocker
they are kidding shit on a plate
the deconstructed lemon tart looks pretty much like what your plate might look like after you've eaten a lemon tart
now that's a dogshit dessert
that looks horrible
apparently walking a catwalk involves putting one foot in front of the other you know like walking
am i the only one out there hoping these two fail hard
what a surprise mess on a plate
omg their desert makes me mad if i got that in a restaurant i would leave and demand my money back
omg do you even plate
no just no
omg cringe at the intro
i would punch the chef in the face if they served me a dessert that looked like that- hard
yes the dish is refined nothing says refined like being too lazy to put a fucking tart together
that's dessert it's one mouthful
pretty like us
to get the skin really crispy you have to burn it alive in front of its family
this is true satire it's just no words
call that a serving of sorbet my dog does bigger shits than that
deconstructed lemon tart brought to you by heinz baby foods
smears on a plate for real
yuk
hot lemon curd no grrrrrrrrrrr
mascarpone aaaand marscarpone sorbet how's this gonna work out
lmao i think they will be crucified with this one
here comes a roasting
deconstructed lemon tart yum
looks stupid
there doesn't seem to be enough of anything
this is bad cooking and good tv all in one
had to tune into to see what twitter was on about fuck me
that awkward moment when all your guests are better models than you
what in the fuck is a promo model anyway
omg i love the pommies that's partly bc i am one they are great
deconstructed mean rustic now good to know i make deconstructed stuff all the time then
this dessert is making me sad
let's be honest i feel like there's going to be a mines bigger than yours contest between drasko and steve
do i make you horny baby told you last week not in the slightest
oh bless little lines sand micro herbs bless bless bless
yep - karlie kloss et al are shaking in their boots
yum there cooking up a storm
this is the kind of catwalk you see in penrith or parramatta westfield
and the oxygen masks fall down from the ceiling
my eyes are burning
''for that catwalk you gotta have that postya''- also it means you don't have to speak so i'm all for more of that
wrong again steve
until now the evening was in danger of not being the worst thing that has ever happened
sick of the word sassy
fingers crossed the lemon curd will catch on fire
nikki you should've changed the ballet flats for a pair of stilettos
is that watercress with the dessert
i think i just threw up in my mouth
love the catwalk - that's about it
steve gt drasko seriously
sorry but who changed the channel to the next top model
the strategy is working tonight are having to make up their own tweets lol
this is cringeworthy
nikki looks like jai'me walking the catwalk
criteria clearly places actual cooking ability way at the bottom
deconstructed lemon curd sounds complex hope it puts the pro in promo
i love this show
how awkward
the girls are bringing the heat
get these blonde bogans off my tv please
the confidence was way too much
steve is acting so much like drasko that i'm starting to dislike him too
drasko is asserting his superiority over steve as a fellow aspiring chef by making his hair taller with every dinner
did just edit your tweet on screen
are these two for real
i just can't do it post a lame inane tweet to see it on tv
hang on think i've figured out what the next twist is this episode is just a joke yeah they're havin' a laff surely
dessert so deconstructed you have to go coles buy the ingredients and make it yourself
fuck me sideways drasko's attempts at communication are utterly painful to behold
i'm just so embarrassed for her
i love sassy food haha i love humour xd
that just happened right the catwalk the cat-bloody-walk
i have no words bs meter overload
rob ditch your hat
deconstructed anything is just a lazy way to make a dish
anyone who claims to be sassy doesn't really understand the concept of being sassy do they
wow i didn't see the catwalk thing coming
super model fail
katie amp nikki from are on tomorrow we want to find some more sexy butchers know any
o m g taking the piss with these two surely
the 'let's see who can sound like a bigger knob' contest between steve and drasco is the only thing carrying this episode
ewww who picks at their partners teeth at the bloody table
if there was a god she would have fallen off
of course they doing a cat walk course but i thought this was a cooking show not top model
stop the sass
these girls r revolting
apparently walking a catwalk involves putting one foot in front of the other you know like walking
omg fashion parade time
the sorbet is looking awesome the sorbet churner not so much
the strategy is working tonight are having to make up their own tweets lol
someone takes herself too seriously
sick of the word sassy
they are having a laugh aren't they
i've been walking wrong my whole life
this is turning into a particularly awful come dine with me
oh god please don't please just stop
can't watch this anymore cringe
say sass one more time
team steve
deconstructed lemon tart basically a pile of crap on a plate
good to see worse cooks in the kitchen than myself
it's definitely won't have a sorbet at least it wouldn't if they could cook
really
a deconstructed tart is a biscuit and dip
i just googled 'drasko' and this is what it came up with i'm feeling short changed
lemon curd has lemon in it nikki your powers of deduction even amaze the kids on the short bus
how sassy is lemon the sassiest of citrus
omg this churner feels like razor blades on my hand oh wait
phew the lemon curd has lemon in it
what a relief they're lucky they realised their mistake
'bloody' sorbet
my dad and baba would be horrified if chevapi were served like that that's not how you do chevapi
haha razor blades it's made of plastic
hahahahah
the veggie crisper will cool it down faster ladies
omg this churner feels like razor blades on my hand oh wait
this is seriously unbelievable
hand modelling career over
shame the razor blades weren't near your throat
now slitting wrists into the sorbet yum
oh my god
learn how to open cans gee
lazy person's menu tonight
deconstructed vomit
i feel like if i were on and had botched the first two courses i'd just serve jell-o shots for dessert
dumb dumb dumb dumb
deconstructed lemon tart basically a pile of crap on a plate
really
deconstructed anything just sounds lazy here try my deconstructed muesli bar hands you a bag of trail mix
what's going on with old mate's hat
let's hope they bring it home with the dessert go girls
are coles marketing paleo sugar yet
remove the fucking hat at the table
which team do you think will be eliminated tonight
what part of cooking show screams tinned food
deconstructed because you can't be bothered putting it together
come on girls u can win
those sausages nikki and katie made look like they jumped up onto the bench and laid a turd in their bowls
i dededeconstructed my tart so i just jammed a lemon in colin's mouth
can we stop deconstructing desserts please let's start a campaign let's get some names on a clipboard let's start a march
oh if only colin washed his hair
runny is fine after all it is deconstructed
i knew nikki reminded me of someone
this is what i'd make my famous lemon meringue pie no deconstruction needed it's awesome as it is
oh look new idea and in a synergistic cross promotional marketing paradigm thingy what about a paleo range
we've got wrapped up robaboon and zozo strangers that have never met
drasko drongo
ash would eat these two alive
you gotta love how the contestants just repeat the critiques of the judges
can't wait to see the walking at london fashion week
so this seems to suggest steve has had a fling with nikki amp they make it through
is that steve on the anzac ad
i'm as sassy as a sausage in a butcher's shop
selling it as 'deconstructed' is an excuse for not being able to prepare the actual dish
miss has just asked why didn't they do the sorbet first to ensure that it's frozen in time
the meal sounds fab
drasko amp steve should be the david and margret of restaurant reviews
it's looking like lynn and tony will be safe
that spatchcock juice that they put in the couscous looked like the gelatinous jelly that comes in a spam can gross
i get emotional because it makes for good ratings
i like these girls we're totes pretty so let's get the men thinking with their spatchcocks but how oh
i am seriously doubting that they have spent more than a few hours in a kitchen in their whole lives
deconstructed is to food what shabby chic is to decor in other words an excuse for a whole bunch of random shit thrown together
the girls need to learn how to churn
lmao katie and nikki strutting on coles rt vid
nikki katie from annoy me hope this pops up on the screen
ooohhh the dessert thought you were talking about nikki amp katie for a minute
i really hope katie and nikki butcher this menu rt vid
deconstructing things needs to end
my mamma once told me that having your hat on at a table is rude
girls the ice cream churner isn't broken you just got the middle bit turned upside down
hey voice over man your so over the top now seriously you're taking the piss eh
which team do you think will be eliminated tonight
you have the paddle upside down in the ice cream machine
nooooo i missed the critique on the entree missed main now we're onto dessert
spatchcock-infused couscous in the microwave amp clothes from a supre sale
oh that was a typo guys for dessert you get sorbent you'll need it after the spatchcock
does drasko really think they cooked half birds and he wants to be a chef
can someone tell rob to take his hat off at the table it is soo rude
who's gay
ohhhhh it's hit the fan trouble she come
i wish everyone knew how much of a non gentleman that slick english guy from is also hate myself for watching this
who's the dude wearing a hat to the table grandma would give him a good hit for being so rude
crumble curd and cream is a deconstructed lemon tart isn't it
for dessert we're making deconstructed lemon tart because we do not know how to construct stuff
miss has just asked why didn't they do the sorbet first to ensure that it's frozen in time
this is even better than the can opener
did they try turning it off and back on again
rt katie and nikki need to be deported from australia rt vid
i still refuse to believe that his real name is drasko
i have been listening to more than watching heard snatch cock and thought yeh they go together
oh if only colin washed his hair
mummy can we use the kitchen we have friends over
she totally just got that juice out the bin didn't she please tell me it wasn't only me who saw that
how's this for sassy from but if i hear that word again i'll throw a shoe at the tv
no juice in curd unusual
not surprised this instant restaurant looks like the playboy mansion class girls class you have none
but sorbet is dairy free
they cant get a can opener working how they going to get the ice cream maker to work
it's upside down you idiot
pucker lips lol
i'm sure the pot that it was cooked in was hot rt vid
that main looked like it was very bland
steve looks like he wants to jump on the table and headbutt drasko
talk the talk but can't walk the walk
this technical failure must make their stomachs churn
she's put the arm in the wrong way
so never used the ice cream maker before
how can you refine something by deconstructing it
refining thru deconstruction right blondes
nikki's pouting is annoying me i'm ready to wipe it off and kick her off the show
note in a spatchcock dish the pomegranate being the star of the dish is not a good thing
okay credit where it's due well done girls comeback maybe
'deconstructed' aka a mess
how do you deconstruct a lemon tart it's custard in a tart shell
deconstructed because you can't be bothered putting it together
if you have to keep talking about how hot you are not hot
sassy looks rubbish i would not eat there
not sure if colin or snape
lets serve colin chev up sausages
these girls on mkr are giving me the shits
i really really hope one of them falls down the stairs
oh the sass
how gross that the blondes kissed the table everywhere hygiene anyone
sassy looks rubbish i would not eat there
sassy = naff
deconstructed lemon tart that would have went with the deconstructed kebab in my toilet on sunday morning
lemme guess the blondies stay south africans go
i hope this instant restaurant round is a good one getting a bit over them
time have a feeling that the remote may go through the tv over the next hour with these two clowns
the quality of on-screen tweets on tonight is pretty equivalent to so i'll go with that policy looks undercooked
returns in once the all the couples intruders gate crashers and second-chancers are eliminated
wow i was so excited to finally get out of instant restaurant rounds and there's another one again so boring big stuff up
but how could you hold jobs amp still catch up with every night
channel sticking it into channel over the contestant who plays tennis probably in cahoots with each other to lift ratings
and that's just the girls
the quality of on-screen tweets on tonight is pretty equivalent to so i'll go with that policy looks undercooked
yes vicky and celine would be in for that
you're all hungry to move on in the competition you have to kill and eat the other competitors last ones standing win
you've got big hearts colin i believe what you're meant to say was that they have enlarged clogged hearts
kinda sad lynn and tony left
will be offering us a pension seems that this season of is never going to finish
someone should just serve up some lines and a chocolate tube wafer for dessert
colin scoring for the ratings tonight a for a roasted bird that wasn't stuffed and couscous other teams must feel ripped off
that hotpot looks like all of the bristol stool chart on one plate
just catching up on tonights i am definitely going to be yrs old by the time this show ends
don't think i'm watching a th round of bad chefs was looking forward to next challenge
leaving lip prints all over the table nice unsanitary way to start things yuck why not spit on the plates too
really so is going around again for another round this series won't be ending until next year at this rate too much of a good thing
does it end next year
the number of rounds is actually getting ridiculous now stop this tv show loves itself way too much
they're both as awful as each other those accents are clearly fake
can't even make your own chicken stock
contestant living 'indulgent lifestyle' while owing creditors over
who knew that was how to do it
such a rigged show how the hell did katie amp nikki make it through
you confused me in a good way really colin i'm not confused now i realise you're a bargain bin cookbook chef
has been on for months and we have only lost teams
food handling alone they failed because of those saliva in kissy lippies yuck
lets get these spatch cocks out
hey is dying a slow death even looks a better alternative
seriously two couples who could actually cook are gone while two others clearly should not even be on the show reputations in ruins
so it's good to see this season of mkr is now going to go for months
bloody colin maybe he should go to spec savers
i hope this round humbled the girls they can't cook
breaking eliminated from wait
ok enough instant restaurants already
can someone deconstruct drasko please perhaps another serve of croatian sausage might gag him
i wouldn't eat anything those girls cooked tonight but mention spatchcock to drasko and he's all smiles
ok the way she handled that sorbet maker was gross
at this rate will they ever make it to kitchen hq
another instant restaurant round why
is such a drag my gosh
omg how many instant restaurant rounds are we gonna have it's not like anyone will score fairly as if kat will do that grrr
just what needed more instant restaurants
another fricking instant restaurant round
was nikki amp katie not present at their instant restaurant where is their confidence coming from
oh great another fucking instant round
that's rounds of instant restaurants i'm done you've screwed up
one woman protest - can not stand another round of instant restaurants bye bye
thought i saw it
a th round of instant restaurants i thought was enough this year don't get me wrong i love this show but seriously
so many no names lined up i thought it was 'i'm a celebrity get me out of here '
how's colin and these rounds working for you pretty crap i'd say from the tweets
bring back the more interesting teams thank god
what a crock for dessert you're kidding better be a good surprise
oh god you just scraped through they didn't underestimate you that much
i wish the would stop saying sass
thanks for once again letting the dramatic ones through - so boring
who would have thought gracious winners not
really wtf sass this is ment to be a cooking comp not a run way for you know what's whatever
fucking rigged - r u kidding they didn't even make a mediocre meal - there was no sass - they just being kept for ratings - i'm
deconstructed a lemon curd or was it turd
is going to kill the golden goose with more instant restaurants same thing happened with masterchef restrict supply create demand
why is so white
apparently cooking skills have nothing to do with succeeding on as opposed to the drama you can provide channel to boost ratings
sassy but sweet ugh that the question
if i hear the word sass one more time im gunna blow
i wouldn't order anything on katie and nikki's menu in a restaurant
it looked like colin just turned up to the prom without a date
i cannot believe katie amp nikki went through they barely cooked
so i see channel have found another way to drag out for an extra few months this year
whoa that's low oh well lol
okay seriously how many instant restaurant rounds are we doing this year this is ridic
i love it when these judges compromise their values because the channel script writers tell them to no credibility
argh another round of instant restaurants over it
say sass one more time
the season finale will be a christmas special
the next time katie and nikki cook they use everything from tins amp packets amp their dessert is a block of chocolate amp a tub of cream
no consistency in the scoring woeful
they should have called their restaurant crumbs'r'us
'my kitchen rules ' recap eva and debra become the highest scoring team in - au
my kitchen rules episode recap eva and debra serve up a record -
ugh kat and andre
view here
methinks the producers won't be so happy about this bit of pete evans publicity
this is fckd fck you kat and andre
me my self and i
maybe weeks down and there is still teams left
wtf is manu saying can't understand him
psycho eyes you are a truly horrible person
omfg kat i will cut you for being horrible do not
poor colin not looking his best
kat is horrid horrid diaf
i never thought i would want katie and nikki to do well but here we are
pete and manu like it stfu kat you are gross
why do the ugly hearted and untalented people always thrive on kat and andre should've gone home such bitter assholes
voting strategically on is one of the lowest things you can do you're sitting bottom of the redemption round clearly not going to win
credit to kat she puts a hell of a lot more effort into badmouthing others than she does her cooking
well i was under the illusion that this show was about cooking turns out its just about who can be the biggest bitch
yep same but it's also wrong of to let them get away with it
don't wish ill horrible behaviour disappointed you are from wa all the way
i've seen vermin more lovable than kat amp andre
at least we have one wa team we can be proud of go just shhhh sto
maybe if kat and andre spent as much time focusing on cooking rather than strategy they'd actually do well
glad i can get back to my life now the fun part of is over and the faux masterchef part has started
ffs last year wa had chloe amp kelly and now we have kat amp andre channel doesn't like perth haha
kat your sour face is repulsive
what genius thought that letting teams score their competition was a good idea playing really dirty
she is such a bee eye tea see h
colin's back
kat and andre are bad representatives of perth non wa's i promise most people in perth are more like eva amp debra
even if kat amp andre gave them the they wanted they still would be there and the blondies still woulda gone home
not really a fan of but would've rather they stayed than
couldn't feel more different about the wa teams proud as punch of eva amp debra just want to punch kat amp andre pair of fucktards
strategy is over now nowhere to hide
oh balls have to put up with bloody kat still
what i have taken from is that if all you served was a big bowl of crackling for every course you would be nailed on for
can't believe how nasty are embarrassed they're representing wa
omg can't wait to see kat and andre royally stuff it up in the challenges my fingers are already starting to twitch
that main course actually looks delicious i would eat everything but the pork cutlet
it is called crackling stop being pretentious amp calling it crackle
not scoring fairly is called cheating
bah not going to watch my kitchen rules anymore lost all credibility with how low everyone scored katie and nikki senseless viewing
you can't cook go home kat and andre slimy cheating humans
please let kat amp andre get the boot please
that's fucking low you two are pathetic
why don't you just give them a and shut the fuck up
if you have to score strategically low to stay in the comp means you can't cook
jelly much kat andre is no catch
can kat and andre shut the fuck up like how selfish are you
jfc kat do you have no morals carnt
thanks pete totally don't feel bad about using my fingers to get my food on my spoon now
lloyd likes thing intensely meaty no surprises there
why is all the excess pastry around the sides of the pans
the rosti looks like one massive chip that has been in the fryer too long it wont be good
what a horrible human you are to score a you're not even good at cooking get out of here
chicken livers do they have chianti
the only one who did strategic voting was you kat amp andre bloody getting on my nerves
flirting omg staaahhhp fug
hahaha as if you can talk sorry what did you do in your first round
those chicken livers look massive did they come from foghorn leghorn
i fucking hate mkr
omg i want that foooooddddd go girls
let's hope the goat is as happy as this
will history be made tonight coming up next
when manu tries to steal your pork crackling
omg they have been double ding-donged
must say i would be up for this main
let's hope the goat was happy
soooo love that emma made a comment and had a dig at kats strategic behaviour bout bloody time
katie and nikki may have been too into themselves but kat and andre are far too into crapping on everyone else
isn't sauerkraut meant to be fermented cabbage
omgosh i hate kat and andre from
the girls tonight have talked it up they need to deliver they better get some pork on there fork
i hope you're not
kat is definitely an a grade bitch but channel will be loving it she's a ratings puller everyone loves to hate her
don't like liver
so it's fair for kat and andre to score the girls a even though they deserved more you kept most hard to watch couple in the
such food much intense so wow much competition
i must say - sheri is gorgeous lovely person - i'd be happy to know her
yes sheri you tell them
use ketchup
just read joel has left and kat and andre are still in bad outcomes tonight on reality tv tonight boo
going through the tweets rarely have i seen the c word used so often
people that rely on the misfortune of others should not be given air time on australian tv get a life kat and andre
sheri amp emilie are my faves they seem like such genuine girls
did anyone else see that the livers were called mains via the onscreen graphics
go girls you got it go gueensland and stop being mean kat and andre
oops typo i meant one big bowl of shit
banter
after a spur of the moment roast lamb for its offical i should apply for
good luck to the people on
kat you are a dick
eww chicken livers yuck
none of this dish makes sense it's bits and pieces of crap put together to make on big bowl of shit
and here comes the kitchen hq crew
hope the girls do good tonight
kat your behaviour is appalling and embarrassing soooo glad your not in my family tsk tsk
sheri i give you a as eating otgans doesnt scare you i like you to try new things and i take you to your happy
it's not sauerkraut lol
the fact that everyone is hoping katie and nikki do well just shows how much australia hates kat and andre
kat and andre need to fuck off
can't recall ever seeing anything so unappealing in the kitchen the chicken livers arent doing much for me either
not going to continue watching if it's going to be the kat and andre show
literally cannot decide which team i like less vs
say what you will about the but their apple pie does sound kick-ass
i hope kat and andre are eliminated next i'll make it happen
you're not wrong can't wait for their comeuppance
for all you pissed about kat getting through - just think of the twitter fun we are going to have at her expense next round
kat and andre playing the game to win sometimes it's so unfair
bitterness is a dish best not served at all kat
it's time redemption round starts now wa
appalling behaviour by kat and andre hope the sour grapes sting on the way out
oh nooo goodluck y'all
it's for toasting sandwiches not cooking potatoes for head chefs
a are you fuckin serious fair suck of the sav kat amp andre
it's kat amp andre vs katie amp nikki in the last redemption round instant restaurant who will escape elimination
how and why did kat and andre make it through they're seriously awful
i'm not opposed to the creative edit but im finding it clumsily jarring and unsubtle in
kat = cunt
just caught up on - i think it's safe to say kat and andre are the worst i actually wanted the blondes to stay amp they
i rufuse to watch after seeing kat go through to the next round forget the food may the biggest bitch win
even if i didnt like their food id score them an just because i hate kat and andre
forgot how many f amp in wankers are on just when you think u get rid of two twelve more walk in
kat amp andre recognise this it's dignity you two have completely lost yours
in the next round kat will cook andre just to get to the next round
i didn't even like katie and nikki but oh my god kat and andre need to leave right now
kat is showing her true colours
why why why
the best way to win is to cook well said by far an excellent reprimand towards and
wa r the biggest bitches ever
well that's mkr done for the year seriously does anyone watch past the instant restaurant rounds
tough words pete from someone whose paleo cook book for babies was just pulled due to the possibility of under-nourished babies
cannot believe kat and andre are still there omfg don't even deserve to be there lol i can't stand them soz not soz
honestly how can any of them attempt to cook well without at least half a bottle of shiraz in them
i'm tempted to give them a ten given their chicken liver entree might help to kill babies
this round manu and i will not be at every challenge i'm fighting a negated cook book deal in court
as much as i was looking forward to the girls getting their comeuppance i absolutely hate kat amp andre bloody ridiculous scoring
kat and andre have become the worst ever couple on in my eyes
kat and andre are behaving in such a spiteful vindictive manner who do they think they are - contestants
honestly how can any of them attempt to cook well without at least half a bottle of shiraz in them
so kat and andre from just leave a bad taste in your mouth very poor losers that's for sure
i think i'd rather slightly over cooked pork chop than dishwater fish soup
kat and andre suck hope they get eliminated soon
kat amp andre you only got through tonight because of your scoring why smile means u can't cook u have to cheat sad
kicking my toe is better than kat and andre
i think we all know kat amp andre r not gonna go far kat kinda reminds me of that old fart from last year
to not score meals on their merits but say it's only fair you stay in the comp is a joke karma will come soon
wow what a low life cow kat is
fuck kat and andre what bloody cheats
i hate kat and fucking andre what a pair of mutty unsportsmanlike dogs
kat and andre do not deserve to be in the competition
is a disgrace
i feel we're in for one hell of a ride on thanks to the inclusion of crazy-kat
kat and andre don't deserve to stay in the competition it's about good cooking not strategic voting
no kat is still in the competition get out get out
bugger not bye bye blondes
i was hoping someone would say let's get kat out we'll score a
kat and andre are scum i am going to get such joy when you are eliminated
oh god all these people that i don't like that i'd forgotten about
i hope in the next round kat and andre catch on fire amp andre
- some people don't deserve to be on
kat - -
it wasn't strategic voting kat it's just your food was truly awful
or hit her with the so called bread she made that'd knock her out
wow new low kat and andre
when a shows results are judged by bitchiness and not merit of the meal im not watching anymore producers stop the rot
a you are real arseholes
kat and andre are making me mad wanna kick them in the face every waking minute andre is a fuckheads name kat- you are a feral mole
those cheats that gave the girls a should be chucked off the show
not even the roaches amp rodents would eat kat amp andre's food
that's appauling you give a if they serve vegemite toast
i don't know if i'm happy or not on one hand i really don't like the promo girls on the other well we're all thinking it
who else is looking forward to kat and andre's pending elimination
umm that's actually so fucked kat and andre suck hair balls they should of gone they can't cook amp they are fucking bitches
considering kat has no job she probably has heaps of time to read all our awful tweets
congratulations kat and andre you came second last
kat is a disgusting failure vampire what a bloody shambles what a winner
wow i really don't like those blondes but i'd like to see kat go down slowly and painfully
love all these people having a go at kat like she is the only one ever to vote strategically in history happens every year
kat and andre don't deserve it hope they destroy them in the group rounds
i wished kat and andre would have left damn it i can't stand them
so disappointed strategic scoring sucks
kat's face on hearing the score
kats a rat
go ladies love the sound of the crackling
cat needs to understand that she is a terrible cook and needs to strategically vote herself out of the competition
she really looks like the kat that swallowed the canary
kat amp andre should be disqualified as they're giving people low scores on purpose
kat and andre are so awful wtf is wrong with you two
i really want to fly kick kat in the head
kat + andre = retards
voting strategically is logical if coldblooded it's a fault in the show that people can turn to it drama sells
kat you snake even if you win and open your own restaurant who's going to go
whole flathead
kat you truly are a bitch and the lowest form of a human being the only saving grace is that the other teams can cook
kat and andre are absolute dickheads
kat and andre drown yourself
i think this year all the action is in the kitchen not 'the block'
i've never hit a woman before but kat is really really pushing my boundaries ugly fucking mole
as much as i didn't like katie amp nikki in their first episode i've begun to hate kat amp andre so much more over the last
kat + andre = retards
kat and andre are so awful wtf is wrong with you two
kat and andre are so annoying pls go home
kat amp andre should be disqualified as they're giving people low scores on purpose
for instant restaurants lowest teams score should be not counted to balance any strategic votes and then it's out of
has mkr lost all credibility as a competition permitting a teams scoring a they admit freely is just to get through a little further
kat and andre are f amp ing wankers hope they burn themselves next round revenge is a dish best served cold
congratulations kat you are now up there with the most hated people in australia tonight pure bitch
well done for keeping scum on the show hope kat and andre end up poisoning all you fuckers
tonight's result proves that smug arseholes can prosper
kat amp andre the only ones in history to give a and all for strategy you don't deserve to be in the competition
i don't want to end
a one kat and andre how does it feel to be the most despised people in australia
if the contestants knew the first thing about food and then voted poorly i'd be offended so not a food show anymore
strategic voting is the winner tonight not food
that's appauling you give a if they serve vegemite toast
how the fuck did kat and andre get thru
come on everyone kat and andre are just pulling in the viewers and underneath we just want them to be around to stir everyone up
i'm not a fan of the blonde butchers but those scores seemed awfully low
kat and andre are honestly the most annoying spiteful just irritating muppets i have ever seen they won't go home but fuck i hate them
a one kat and andre how does it feel to be the most despised people in australia
kat and andre you fucking conniving arseholes a fucking one that's it i'm done you are simply evil and not worthy of this show
a hmmmmm
don't know about you but i'm soooo over so called strategic voting
you bloody arseholes kat and andre to score that low is absolutely bs
kat the contradictory cow says she regrets voting strategically but does it again
what a horrible human you are to score a you're not even good at cooking get out of here
kind of disappointed the 'promo girls' have gone they weren't very nice but kat from wa is horrid
everyone's face at the table on hearing kat's strategic scoring delusion
she shall now be known as sourpuss
normally i'd give them a three but i feel like i'm not quite universally hated yet
kat and andre are the fuckin devil
are you serious a score of uh i hate kat and andre
kat and andre are awful giving a
the fuck do you know about fair kat
ooooooh c'mon livers crossed
what happened in i was at indoor soccer
kat and andre cheats much
whatever i want to see what cringe worthy moments kat amp andre produce out in challenges it'll be amazing
and can both go fuck them selves
i think annie is on sleeping medication or something
just go home already
i preferred the activated almonds pete evans rather than this new dangerous baby diet pete evans
i feel like a producer should step in and stop people doing this
can't believe no one knows the difference between sauerkraut and red cabbage sauerkraut is pickled cabbage people
look at kat and andre they're hoping that dessert is a festering pussie boil
kay needs to simmer down
deconstructed apple pie bwilliant
kat is such a witch someone throw water on her
i watched tonight kat and andre should be disgusted with themselves uncalled for on so many levels
as much as i dislike them that dessert does look good
why does everyone say they are voting strategically rather than being honest and saying they are blatantly cheating
because everyone wants to hit kat with a shovel
everyone's face at the table on hearing kat's strategic scoring delusion
that pastry looks awful
kat ugliness exudes from within hence a reflection in ones physical appearance lighten up girlfriend
kat you've been owned there's only one way to stay in this competition - cook good food manu
kat seems to be getting 'strategic' mixed up with you can't cook and you got scored accordingly
hahahaha thank you amp andre i advise that you apply water to the burned area of your dignity
snap manu - best judge reply on that ur bad score is because of strategic voting do they realize they have to cook good well too
when nobody strategically scores you yet your bottom of the comp table hahaha
kat says we're last because everyone scored us strategically manu says the way to win is cook good food meaning your food was shit
in other words your food was crapilicious
you suck kat and andre poorest form ever onya manu only way to stay in this competition is to cook good food
kat and andre are a disgrace they should be booted to score that low to save themselves pffft
are kat and what's his face paid actors surely people can't be that negative all the time
bam manu just put kat in her place
get rekted kat and andre
well said manu
so useless didn't even finish that episode of might have to leave catching up for the weekend
if katie amp nikki go i hope one of them give kat a left hook on the way out what a bitch
hahahahaha
kat and andre did not appear once in the preview of the next round of the comp gone early hope so yay
my fav teams so far are definitely eva amp debra rose amp josh annie amp loyd robert amp lynzy sherie amp emilie jaz amp shaz not
when nobody strategically scores you yet your bottom of the comp table hahaha
the way kat looks at annie is like she's stearing into her soul it's just creepy
what a disgraceful episode of mkr hope kat and andre fail and that smirk is wiped off their face
i really want that pork crackling
i hope colin tears kat and andre a new one
i love annie and loyld there like a real life disney couple it's so adorable
crossing my fingers for the get rid of
kat and andre must be feeling so f d at this stage it really doesn't matter what they say
why would you be such dicks
what's with petes face looks like he's been varnished
i now officially hate kat and andre i hope karma bites them hard
kat is gonna score low for one there last she's crazy
and a collective fuck you arises from across the country kat you won't last minutes against the other teams
i can't believe it
everybody hates you kat shut the fuck up
i didn't like katie and nikki but i wished it was kat and andre that were leaving
well done kat you literally cheated your way in yeah go you you'll be out the first time you have to cook against real cooks
i would slap the smirk off kat's face
kat is the biggest bitch i've ever had the displeasure of seeing in my life
kat and andre staying is possibly the worst thing to happen on the show ever
ew kat and andre are still in the comp
the way she flirts with the young boys at coles ohhh no
watching gotta love my cooking shows
i never thought i would say that i wanted the blondes to stay on but kat and andre are mean and nasty makes me not
why would anyone want to eat chicken liver that's just ew no
we cook all the time yup they cook so much they don't know how to use a can opener
for the next episode of - kat is going to serve up boiled bunny
watched one more time to see if kat and andre had managed to stop being awful people no not even after manu warned them bye bye
andre you fucking whipped cunt arghhhhh
i would love for someone to accidently spill a pot of boiling water on kats head worst humans cooks ever on the show
omg your behaviour is so embarrassing i wonder what your family thinks of you kat i'd be totally ashamed of you
that awkward moment when kat and andre use the word fair in a sentence do you even know what that means
redemption round thank goodness and home made restaurant cooking is over no where to hide now
if you were bottom of the table twice in one season answers all questions i reckon
um it's birthday week your week to be classy why are you tweeting about
i hope kat and andre die in a kitchen fire next time they cook
bottom two should've gone
i would back hand them both giving them a strategic no you are just being major fkn dicks
that ain't sauerkraut it's rotekohl
go team tex hope they win
kat amp andre monday people have voted strategically how rude kat amp andre tonight votes strategically for the third time in the comp
i was so happy to hear manu take that dig clearly the message didn't sink in kat amp andre
and since the premiere has been on for hours already in total with the extension of all episodes to minutes
cat seems more like a dog with all this strategic voting
can't wait to have robert amp lynzey back
perhaps next season all scores get revealed at the end of each round then ppl like kat amp andre can't strategically score
kat and andre being partially critical we all know that insta-restaurant was worth more than
that pork cutlet and crackling looks so yummy not sure about the other stuff on the plate
i don't like the butcher girls but kat amp andre are dirty players cheats and can't cook
have you guys picked your winners for this year any bets
i disliked annie and lloyd more
what a cunt of a person kat is
kat is a whench boot her off
i would vote a to make sure kat and andre go home you know strategic voting
kat and andre can fuck right off
lance armstrong award for sportsmanship goes to trevor chappell opens envelope announces winner is kat
those carrots look overdone
or you could just stop watching crap like
or you could just stop watching crap like
i would vote a to make sure kat and andre go home you know strategic voting
not strategic just being an a hole calling it something else doesn't make it ok
stop calling it being strategic when really it is being shameless dirtbags
don't be sore losers k amp a
the is out tonight on
surely when you go to a restaurant you have certain expectations given what is written on the menu
strategic or talentless hack you be the judge
live in areas in fans concerned re not in evac centres email police qld gov au
unbelievable how low kat amp andre will go despicable couple can't believe how disgusted i am in their behavior
the world would be a better place if kat and andre left the show
they are complaining that it's taking too long typical of andre and kat
if you want to win you win by cooking good food not by sabotaging other people that's not a win that's cheating kat amp andre suck
kat amp andre congratulations you've just won a one way trip to mars
who got through guys
it's so difficult to choose between the two teams isn't it despicable behaviour much bah
i didn't like the blondes but i wanted kat and andre gone a hell of a lot more i despise them so much they are disgusting people
urgh that's just naff a one
surely when you go to a restaurant you have certain expectations given what is written on the menu
kat didn't like the canoodles
kat the kunt
cannot believe those two fucktards are still in the competition my middle finger says hello to you kat amp andre
imma need some time to get over kat amp andre's blatant cheating

unbelievable how low kat amp andre will go despicable couple can't believe how disgusted i am in their behavior
i'm soo loving the show
kat and andre are seriously shit people

i preferred the activated almonds pete evans rather than this new dangerous baby diet pete evans
i'm out people going to to drown my sorrows in roofied fanta night

kat and andre are behaving in such a spiteful vindictive manner who do they think they are - contestants
how to make brown butter ice cream - with

crackling people
go sassy girls made that apple pie kickass
hope these girls do good really don't want them to go make your main and dessert amazing girls
the dessert looked great i wouldn't have cooked the apples like that but i want to try that icecream
if contestants were to be ousted by kat amp andre's unfair score nikki amp kate were the right ones didn't cook well almost as bitchy
is there something wrong with me i really like kat and andre haha
my crap tastes better than the shit kat amp andre served up i wouldn't feed it to a dead cat
there can only be one so stop trying kat
thought jane was safe with the score of did they forget or i missed the announcement
i like how kat and andre are the ones trending
i want sheri amp emilie to have their own show with special appearances from annie amp lloyd
i can barely tolerate kat and andre katie and nikki are annoying but i'd rather see them than kat and andre
looks yummy the judges make it stressful
i wish annie would stand up and punch kat in the face
kat missed the op to redeem herself in the kitchen but also in the character stakes
katie trusting your instincts is like trusting the instincts of the titanic captain
sheri amp emilie are the cutest whilst kat amp andre are the most vile
couples remain on means if one team is booted out every week and two in semi finals then show will finish mid may
to stop this strategic voting perhaps announce all the scoring for each group of instant restaurants when they go to kitchen central
why the freakin hell do katie amp vikki puree everything
can't decide if i dislike the 'promo' girls more than i dislike kat amp andre either way one of them is gone tonight winning
no sauce for your pork lloyd will be so upset he loves a sauce with his pork
read up land wubbers oh how capt salty smokes small cuts of fish for five minutes in her new cook book shit cooking ahead
this is both season and next they'll advertise it as continuing after the tennis
can't wait for the vic girls ash amp camilla to wreck kat's ass like girrrrl learn manners and etiquette
i hope everything goes well for the girls
cannot wait for kat and andre to crash and burn in the challenges
actually hate kat and andre
no worries pete and manu take all the time off you need in fact feel free to fuck right off - i prefer colin
the bimbos make an awesomely awesome kick ass awesome apple awesome pie which has to be perfectly awesome or they'll go home awesome
purposely pick slightly unattractive girls who're besotted with themselves makes good television lol
good news is kat and andre aren't shown in the promo ads
strategic voting in a cooking competition will only get you so far when you are an oxygen thief that cannot cook
so i just basically started why are they serving chicken livers vomit
can't believe i have to watch more of these two flogs kat and andre on
kat and andre are horrible people who do not deserve to still be in this competition
i'll say it if no one else will that kat needs serious medication
please lose this pete evans clown he is dangerous
as we said in my country fish dies for the mouth see ya girls
arrgh my hearties we get to see captain salty farm more salt thursday and her trusty gimp i mean first mate do nothing at all
i don't like wishing ppl bad luck but gosh i really dislike kat and andre much worse than tennis man
i've been sucked into the trap once again thinking this show isn't rigged when it obviously is
kat's absolutely delusional if she thinks it was strategic scoring that put them on the bottom of the leaderboard
great comeback manu cook some good food next time kat and andre
cooking meals for good thing most of them can't cook for shit wouldn't want to make the airlines food good for once
exciting times on - just teams left
pathetic channel
sorry what was that you can't burn anything on a toastie
it's for toasting sandwiches not cooking potatoes for head chefs
next to be eliminated needs to be kat amp andre for sure
tonight's result proves that smug arseholes can prosper
gotta get home to watch
my prediction next season there will again be judges but they will be manu and colin
promo looks promising pls say their absence means the r the st couple eliminated in the next round ugh
happy to watch my last episode of fucken over it
i hope eva and debra win the competition
kat's face the only thing worse than her cooking
i think only judges scores until the end when contestants just rank the other teams for best for nd etc can't cheat then
kat the rat
the truth behind another elimination round to get rid of
i love how excited kat i mean she can't cook and their turning up the heat as she actually has to cook quality food
katie amp vikki have requested a breville sandwich maker to be added to the kitchen at mkr head quarters
haha aaannndd thats why i love you
kat gives me the absolute shits
worst actually wanted to throw my remote at my tv after that score shitty strategic score you witch
i officially hate kat and andre that's more like cheating than being strategic really heartless animals they are
kat and andre are like the worst they probably don't have friends
well too say i'm pissed off at that result would be an understatement but i'm confident we won't have kandre for long can't cook
i wonder if not having a doorbell disqualifies you from applying to be an contestant
with teams on our screen it means one good thing less kat and more people i like
i have a few favourites
kat is a fucking cunt
why you always make my cry why
hoping editing might be to blame but srsly need to check themselves can't wait till they're out cooked by the other teams
i enjoy for the cooking not to watch feral human behaviour kats gotta go
kat i don't like anything on tonight's menu well go back to hungry jacks then or eat the shit u served up the other night
if you had an ounce of self respect you'd accept that you have room to improve kat and andre you're so disappointing
there seems to be ways to succeed in cook terribly whinge excessively about not getting a fair go and give 's or u know cook
notice we didn't see kat and andre in any of those cut aways
i think the whole country hates right now
and here are the tears get over it you didn't do a good job stop blaming strategic voting
on a lighter note yay no more instant restaurants
there are more people left in this competition than probably live in mount isa
with teams on our screen it means one good thing less kat and more people i like
just not the new breed of
they clearly aren't even trying to hide how rigged it is anymore the girls should have stayed but kat's more controversial
i hope kat and andre's kitchen burns down un-australian their tactics they can't be happy with that
oh no she says sticking needles in her eyes
ok - get this off my fb page asap
can't believe that former tennis wannabe is still on
go manu
you can eliminate teams by strategically voting but what sort of person does that make you a chef or a petty person
time to saddle up
bless i totally forgot about the party favourite shaz
the good news is i did not see one screen grab in future grab bag of eps
please kick off that lady who is such a rude person she has such a crappy attitude towards the others shes gave a one
good news is kat and andre aren't shown in the promo ads
on the other hand you can argue that if strategic scoring wasn't invoked - katie amp nikki still fell short with their menu to stay
i think we can all agree that cooking was the winner
really can't stand kat amp andre terrible cooks but good whingers amp moaners
kat and andre get to stay seriously this is so unfair so not impressed with the strategic scoring karma will be a b tch
we know that you gave it everything you have meaning it's just innate lack of ability that cost you
my only problem is there are worst cooks then captain salty
miss i think you'd get on very well with seeing you both loooooove
we're about to turn the heat right up with another instant restaraunt round australia turns off their tv's
who are all these people i've forgotten
as of now favorite teams on would have to be eva amp debra and will amp steve least favorite would definitely be kat and andre
i hope their cooking shows through the next round i mean they have to plate it up right all their lacking skills
looks like we are in for an emotional rollercoaster going to be great
thank god now the real show can start
the old two wheel colin
cannot wait for kat and andre to crash and burn in the challenges
all of that is on tomorrow wow it's going to be a long episode
so foghorn the english geezers the blandos amp the dead beat dad gets immunity brilliant
is closed hooray for the end of instant restaurants and time to head to kitchen hq for challenges we asked for change and got it
i have a feeling this will be pete's last season and colin will replace him goodbye paleo bullshit
kat and andre should be sent home for cheating twice absolute bullshit they should not see the scores until the end of the show
finally the good part of
that's really low
kat and andre are fd
what how along are they dragging this show on for
i noticed kat and andre weren't in any of those upcoming clips hehehehehee
kat and andre fuck up you're both oxygen thiefs
the scoring wasn't even done honestly
great to see colin just got out of bed for this get together
our favourite teams pushed to the limit so kat and andre will have to cook weetbix and milk then
pretty much how i'm feeling at the end of hope that mole from wa goes asap surely you agree
kat amp andre seem to have some very strong feelings against strategic scoring until they decide to engage two horrible people
how is the deadbeat dad tennis coach friend of the judges still in this show
can someone get that homeless irish guy a jacket that fits
i'm so mad
where's gordon f'ing ramsay
kat and andre are such revolting human beings
oh really no more instant restaurants that's shocking
i hope kat and andre's kitchen burns down un-australian their tactics they can't be happy with that
sorry to say that the real compitition has begun katie and andre but do you have the gumption
lloyds happy with all this meat on tonight's menu
what the actual fuck are they saying there are no more instant restaurant rounds i feel ripped off there were only rounds
the homeless man is back
everyone has immunity this week kat and andre are sure to fail big time
fast snatch is back surprise
so how many teams are we 'starting' with now
was that a wedding i saw would you really want kat and andre catering your big day
it's survivor immunity idols have been issued
yay colin is back
wtf i not a huge fans of the promo girls but they never voted strategically this sucks soo annoyed
france vs ireland vs paleo pete lets rumble
colin is back
outrageous what awful people i hope they are gone in the very next elimination
why don't all the contestants just score each other that evens the field
holy crap are you fucking kidding me another elimination round it's not going to end is it ever
fassnidge
hope they get booted next round
no more instant restaurants
who wrote this script
damn you kat amp andre hope karma comes around and bites you in the arse
there's another judge you have to please he has compromising photos of the executive producers
how to kat and andre keep escaping elimination definitely don't think they're worthy we'll have see how it goes
bless i totally forgot about the party favourite shaz
if i had immunity i'd cook poo sausage
fk you kat and andre
you all respect him you respect him right right
everyone's back this is awesome can't wait to see what they are going to do this year
get some more fucking teams why doncha
if adam wins he can use the money to pay his kid
yay jac and shaz and robert and lynzey my faves
with all this bitchiness i had forgotten about the texan thank god he's back
wish there was a home viewer vote kat and andre would be loooooooooong gone
i like it
more rigged than the block this will be the last time i tweet about and even watch have fun with your ratings fall
for topping your groups you can now invite six friends each to join the competition
did they even have chickens back in caveman times pete
don't fuck with me i fucking despise kat and andre fuck off
kat amp andre there's a special place in hell for people like you
there is a very valid case to be made that strategic scoring by multiple teams impacted the elimination tonight
kat amp andre definitely do not deserve to be still in the competition i'm disappointed once again
kat amp andre are the real losers
kat karma is going to kick you in the arse
there is no way i'd be eating that entree it's making me feel sick
they'll be back in the never say die never say never again round
don't understand how bad sportsmanship can be condoned by
after tonight's elimination on there's now only billion teams left
guess who i am we hate strategic scoring but we give them a
i just want manu to stay
completely disgusted with kat and andre's scoring - really disappointing
kat and andre do not deserve to be in the competition
ahhh the dulcet tones of robert the texan
ok i officially dislike kat the most
'australia's favourites are back' uhh what
just so the results why would the other teams not up the score to drop kick captain salty and her first mate beta
australian women's weekly reports pete evans' book recalled over dangerous paleo recipe for babies
i am so sick of seeing pork crackling on time to do something different people actually i am pretty sick of mkr
i can't believe the result i would have voted strategically to make sure kat and andre didn't make it
nevermind kat and andre have no hope against the other teams now
i miss robert's voice
cannot believe they made it through are they just going to give everyone a for the rest of the comp
kat and andre should get out in the next round shameless
don't be scared of colin don't forget - you're holding the knives
kat and andre must be pretty fucking shit cooks if you need to vote a team
i feel the need to throw something at the tv kat doesn't deserve to go through
i hope kat and andre leave soon very soon
yay robert is back
our judges are about to turn the heat up in the competition what do you think is in store for our remaining teams
and now flashback round come back in eliminated teams
kat just loving the negative reviews
kat and andre can fuck right off
bring back that complete lowlife deadbeat bankrupt asshole adam so we can send twitter into meltdown
can kat and andre a just fuck off they're shit people and even worse cooks
three nsw teams are take that tassie with no team in the comp
so that's a big double announcement for what does everyone think
uggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh fuck off
taralovescats oh my god i can not handle one more ep of kat and andre they are cooking my nut big time
ugh kat and andre are so annoying
kat
france vs ireland vs paleo pete lets rumble
jacquirudd this is why this show is ridiculous - it's not about the cooking it's about the game playing
oh and the unhygienic greaseball returns
fiddle dee dee potaters
love a good generalization about a entire nation of people
colin is back
not a big fan but foul play from kat and andre wow that's poor form
i really hope kat and andre fail in the most spectacularly and humiliating manner possible thoroughly horrible people
well that's bullshit kat and andre do not deserve to get what they want
kat and andre are such assholes omg
colin gave me feelings as he walked out then not sure if good or bad
this show is so unfair
i'm actually disappointed the wa couple are horrible on the plus side they'll go home quickly because their cooking sucks
glad the proper competition is starting and even happier that colin is back
ol' crazy eyes lives to massacre another menu
i really dislike kat amp andre
not that i watch it but still aha
nup not happy
if had any integrity they would disqualify kat and andre for strategic scoring
but you all respect him pete hasn't read twitter has he
kat and andre suck they deserve to go home not the girls
bad sportsmanship by kat un australian
oh well looking forward to kat and andre being booted soon after everyone is brought back together
back to handing out sausage rolls on toothpicks at woolies
eugh piss off kat
everytime someone scores strategically i come closer to throwing something at my tv it is cheating omfg
nsw on the roll killin it
and the producers rejoice more twitter rage for kat hooray ratings
so all contestants shop at the same doorbell store
scoring a just shows you're a douche
top get safety from elimination
the teams all gave crap scores aside from the melbourne girls ridiculous kat and andre shouldn't stay in the competition
nikki's inflection doing my head in
the scoring wasn't even done honestly
are so vile i actually feel sorry for the
wow did not see that coming
bye bye my kitchen rules helloooo the block
the nidge
we know that you gave it everything you have meaning it's just innate lack of ability that cost you
oh my god i can not handle one more ep of kat and andre they are cooking my nut big time
how hard is it to be humble
evil triumphed over a slightly lesser evil i guess that is some sort of moral of some description
seriously i would fucking picket kat and andre's restaurant outrageous behaviour
don't understand how bad sportsmanship can be condoned by
ugh get out
kat and andre i really hope you are eliminated next
bullshit strategic scores piss me off
pete evans looks orange
wait for the wildcard round
how can they get away with that kat amp andre are cunts
kat survived is this real life
kat and andre why are you cheering you are now the worst team in he comp
no
double elimination please
a isn't strategy it's bastedry
absolute bloody bullshit so much shit of bull
this is why this show is ridiculous - it's not about the cooking it's about the game playing
what a goddamn surprise
what in the actual fuck
damn have to put up with more of kat and andre
fucking kat and andre eew
so is watching i have to say that kat seems like an absolute crazy bitch
double elimination its only fair since we had to put up with the loser round
kat amp andre you should be ashamed of yourselves you don't deserve to be there hope you get eliminated next week
hell i've missed you guys
i don't even remember any of these people
utterly no way are kat and andre better cooks than katie and nikki
go sassy people
this is fckd fck you kat and andre
kat amp andre aka worst humans to ever inhabit this earth
kat amp andre have the worst sportsmanship genuinely hope they don't do well purely because of how bitter they are
kat and andre won't survive the next rounds anyway
kat and andre should have been eliminated they suck
i am physically sickened i think i'm officially done with this show for the year seeya
as much as i disliked katie and nikki they deserved to stay i'm quietly hoping a rogue frying pan 'knocks' kat out of the competition
on the plus side we'll get to see kat amp andre cook another delicious meal hahahaha
nooooooooooooooooo
who are these people lol
fuck
i don't remember half of these ppl
channel kate and andre should've gone they are nasty people they need to learn how to cook hope they go soon
can't believe that former tennis wannabe is still on
safe one day but it's not how long you may go but how far does your knife throw
not fair not fair not fair is making people eat your awful rock bread gt
are u fucking serious y did the stay
hope they get booted next round
unfair scoring by kat amp andre c nts
the audience goes boooooo the producers clap their hands with glee
bad news kat and andre are in good news no more horrendous voting from teams
dammit kat and andre are safe not happy
there's still a few teams that need to be voted off the island
if kat and andre survive i'll be spewing
what bullshit kat amp andre rejoicing because they got through but they scored a that's the equivalent of cheating
goodbye katie and nikki
ass cream
with so many rounds going on i can't who are some of these contestants
fuck me
what price a bit of nationally televised dignity
how the fuck are kat and andre still in the competition fuck
i am eternally angry
strategic scoring is wrong secret ballot is the way to go reveal totals at the end
kat and andre got through on strategy and not score how embarrassing you should be ashamed mkr or the biggest loser
mmm mmm chargrilled potato rosti fried on a breville puts fingers down throat
manu to kat the only way to stay in this competition is to cook good food
i'm so sick of and the ridiculous scoring methods i don't buy it
kat is better tv she is a natural villian unlike ash who is a fake one
i blame the other teams for this
you dont deserve to stay kat amp andre
nooooo
good bye mkr kat and andre have turned me off this vile show now
kat and andre celebrating bad cooking bad attitude and strategic scoring absolute champs
maybe it was just a typo they meant to list kickass ice-cream and apple pie
it wouldn't be fair cause voting strategically is fair right kat
so annoying kat amp andre go home
the kick ass part of the dessert was the ass cream kudos manu
tacky vs wacky not sure who i'd like to stay in the competition
ripped off poor girls that's ridiculous
the judges are scoring strategically to get kat out of their sight
booo kat and andre did not deserve to get through
someone please tell me that kat amp andre get sent home tonight
i love the scoring in this show every day it seems to be based on something completely different
if tonight proves nothing else instant restaurants should be judges scoring only pathetic from kat and andre
its not close at all
it was the points kat took off to be strategic
oh no she says sticking needles in her eyes
voting strategically is not 'fighting hard' kat i don't like amp nikki but i wish they pulled thru despite ur score
no flips desks
bull
i didn't really love katie and nikki to begin with but i really preferred them over kat and andre and how shitty they are
well i called it
learn to cook kat amp andre
kat's look of shock what a fake load of shit hope she's a goner as soon as they get back into the main round won no
kat and andre are the sort of people who would look forward to funerals knowing they will be getting a free feed afterwards
evil triumphed over a slightly lesser evil i guess that is some sort of moral of some description
i cry foul boooooooo
ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
even if i didnt like their food id score them an just because i hate kat and andre
and so we say goodbye to the little butcher girls
oh well they have no chance of winning anyway good luck you idiots
lol an from pete is definitely strategic strategic to increase tv ratings
oh no no no it's a conspiracy
that's wrong they don't deserve to be eliminated they did a lot better than kat and andre it's disgusting
twitter is about to explode
fuck kat and andre they are next to go
you need to fix your voting system so it can't be rigged like this
rigged rigged rigged
cya katie and nikki
kat and andre don't deserve to be there ffs
noooooo whyyyyy
nooooo i wanted kat and andre to lose
if only both those bottom teams could be eliminated
bullshit i don't know how many more episodes with kat and andre i could stand
sorry but even if you did make it through there was no way you would have made it to the end
can they just send kat and andre home anyway because they're rude and annoying and score everyone strategically
but i don't ever want to see or hear kat again ever
absolutely disgusting result scoring them a
well i'd never eat it
push them through come on
ok i'm done that mole got through outrageous
that's unfair and fucked up
the girls are through
no no no no no no
kat and andre are now more hated than adam and carol
livers needed fava beans and a nice chianti
nnnnnoooooooooo i can't bare kat and andre
can you just kick kat out for being a strategic arsehole
i love that tie
kat and andre are the worst
i thought manu was going to score for that dessert
i am furious
fml
nah nah nah-nah hey heeeeeyyyyy katie amp nikki
did i hear the guests gave if so that's quite a joke
well shit
kat and andre you need to go
feeling quite sorry for the nsw promo bitches
with spinich - who doesn't love spinich
ok well the score was able to be manipulated by the contestants to let the inferior team through doesn't sound fair really
looks like kat got the cream after all
noooooo kat amp andre survive
the pastry was a little too tall
everyone is scoring strategically get rid of the ones that can cook and keep in kat amp andre that can't cook
bullshit
ughhhh
katie and nikki pissed me off at the start but kat and andre are the worst team on mkr
nooooooooooooooo
a i smell a fine cotten scandal
i hope kat and andre see themselves on tv and are utterly ashamed of themselves
i'm tempted to give them a ten given their chicken liver entree might help to kill babies
who is good at maths what do they need to be safe
they should feel embarrassed by their behaviour everyone played fair but those
wtf score did you expect serving liver
the meals weren't great but they didnt deserve
i blame the other teams for this
strategicscoring should be classed as cheating everyone scored kat and andre fairly and accordingly why can't they do the same
for fuck sake annie sort out that disgusting blush enough is enough
i dont know how i feel this way but i won't the bloody blondes to stay thats just how horrid kat is
they need + to go through
really can't believe i'm still watching this shit
the pink chick has a bad snaggletooth models don't
i predict a point difference in score just saying
katie amp nikki over andre amp katt any day go
hurry up kat and andre are dicks
go eat shit kat and andre pls
i hope don't get kicked off
are just evil
always needs an evil team for ratings kat amp andrew are that evil team they will intentionally survive
wow thats a low group score they deserved a little more don't you think
it wouldnt be fair if u stay u cooked shit
stop smiling kat
kat and andre cant cook
kat's gloating is nauseating
what wuld happen to kat and andre if manu and pete turned around and said double elimination kat's head would explode
judges were frosty when scoring the rosti
whats a roshti
especially formulated by ugg
oh kat
lets see who the producers think are going to be better tv - kat or nikki and katie
i hope the promo's get
can't cope
mmm chicken liver good luck with that
so you know you can do it lol
twist in the plot the bottom teams leave i think everyone would be happy
kat and andre just don't deserve to be there even compared to katie can't cook and nikki hates all food
pete and manu will push them through
is there enough blue in the wardrobe department
really kat and andre good luck girls
if kat and andre stay tonight i will stop watching my kitchen rules
doesn't anyone have a gif of manu saying no you get out cos that would be awesome
do you think kat is happy with that group score
kat is defining fair
by 'fought hard' kat means 'voted strategically'
we were shite cooks amp it wouldn't be fair if we were eliminated we should stay because we can cook worse
i think it's time to get rid of teams scoring other teams it's not fair
kitchen hq is a warehouse in coburg
lowest contestant score in this series
sure kat because nobody else worked hard in the competition
ok that is bullshit and unfair there have been a lot of worst dishes than what they served
is so intense this round
does a kick ass apple pie mean its shit
that's the spirit
just like last season if the bitter team gets through i'm not going to keep watching
this team score is disgraceful
don't go bacon my heart i couldn't if i fried
please let it be kat and andre going home just wanna wipe that smug look off her face
time to catch up on there are so many nice people and then there's cat and andre
view here
time to lightly sautee and caramelise our dear pm
pete evans the paleo capitalist has had his cookbook pulled
how can u be happy abt urselves still being in the competition purely coz u scored strategically n not coz u cooked well
kat and andre are the crud on the bottom of a saucepan when you burn your food
predictable sudden death recipients but that's not the judges fault
oh wow surprised me that ash and camilla won peoples choice but it is well deserved
rose and josh are great haha
high quality food amp they have frozen beef cheeks
those eggs aren't cooked at all
how bianca puts up with drasko is beyond me
praying jac and shaz do well they're my faves
finally catching up on last nights
last nights looked like a crossover with heading towards the food
and can both go fuck them selves
early morning baking baked raspberry ripple cheesecake - my kitchen rules - official site
if i knew that kat and andre were gonna score strategically i'd probably score high just to counter them and hopefully get rid of them
watching before lel

chicken bones instead of breast milk how much damage will this idiot be allowed to do to the brand
the image is from amp - like combining amp
there's a paedo cookbook for children that's horrific ohhh you meant paleo that's worse
i expect to see this on an episode of a reality cooking show soon
i really love it when a celebrity tweets or messages me makes my day got a shoutout from helena from last years on insta today
pete evans says his critics will eat humble pie although the humble pie will be made from raw mammoth acorns and grass
sounds amazing see you weren't inspired by to do a 'deconstructed lamb shank pie' ie lamb shank amp a tough biscuit
star and chef pete evans says his critics will eat humble pie
are kat and andre the most loathsome people on tv
did you know that in comparison to lean cuts of beef game meat has about fewer calories
kat's reaction to every critique haha
awwww now i want some of those prawn cakes and i'm not even a fan of prawns haha
their house situation is so weird tho i am not for walking across a park to get to the front door
i love being on lsl

time to cheer on twinners on learn more about them here
great to have the new darlings of aussie tv ash and camilla on my morning
spot of rain won't stop the pigs cooking see you at
damn how did kat and andre dodge that bullet
figured out my hit list kat and andre kat and andre kat and andre but once they're gone much harder choice fro next

manu is apparently showing signs of stress from working with a 'flesh coloured dalek'
view here
once again kat and andre make it through again which producers dick did they suck to get through i'm fucking hate them
great to have the new darlings of aussie tv ash and camilla on my morning
time for last nights catch up we now have to stomach a mismatch of teams who some i've forgotten even existed here we go
thu tv seven m news news h amp a k abcn k aca k k celebrity the block k
the contestants on should cook with as much dairy amp carbs as possible just to piss off glorified cook pete evans
viewers turning on perth pair kat and andre for their desperate strategic scoring
producers are certainly capitalising on the hatred people are feeling towards kat and andre by their edits - always a vindictive smirk
so kat and andre trending in australia nice to see twitter
hope kat and andre don't have kids - would hate to think of their kids being exposed to such spiteful attitudes
viewers turning on perth pair kat and andre for their desperate strategic scoring
also wow that editing is doing a number on kat she's cast as 's answer to lance armstrong and mussolini mixed together in a bake
conclusions celine is legitimately hilarious rob and dave are running out of talladega nights references that salmon looked amazing
since when did give a fuck about science go sell your advertisers cosmetics wuth their wild claims
oh my gosh they played ready to run on tonight i was soo happy
has done you a favour then
mighty killer rats eat out the kitchen
kat and andre sunburnt lol
i wpuld've given katie and nikki a high score just to get rid of kat and andre
steve is back tuesday i love dick again
vicky and celine will win this shit go girls i love yall beat satan
yup totally agree hope they are out soon
that's rigged they have to keep her in for her mouth yet their food was shit again
and that's karma
i'm not liking them very much they are a bit mean
was waiting for the close up of kat's face with lannie's critique
the mother daughter team tried to steal amp kelly's spanish baked egg dish
those parents need to teach their rude inpatient bratty kids some manners disgraceful
the whole mom son - im proud of you you're proud of me crap is getting a bit much also
crime against cooking ha ha
time to catch up on and say goodnight but i'll probably get up and make myself something to eat soon anyway
is colin hot
that bacon tho
suggest you drop a dangerous grubby lunatic from colin a funnier better chef amp judge
is it time for channel to reconsider their association with the dangerous man
anyone else sick of hearing from contestants on get a new script rt if you agree
loved watching the qld boys cook up some on
ooh so worried for sheri and emily they are two of my favourites
i forgot how much i dislike the mum and son team
argh all of these contestants are so frustratingly annoying
i want those caramelised bananas and coconut crumb pancakes
back on twitter just for
i really don't understand why kat hates annie amp lloyd so much
kat amp andre would be the type of people that see they are trending on twitter amp think it's because they are liked delusional
kat and andre's dish looks shit again
australia wins at having the most attractive chefs
the judges are the only ones getting me through this episode
go team sheri and emilie you girls rule
can a camper please push into that lake wash that look of their face
can we eliminate colin and bring back manu
umm wheres manu
does anyone think annie's boyfriend lloyd looks like butthead from beavis amp butthead
cringing every time i see kat amp andre
oh man i love pancakes finally on in wa
digging this challenge it's making me hungry
maple bacon way to ride the american food trend blokes
used to hate now i enjoy watching the producers brazenly manipulate perceptions it's almost art
they may like it but it's no replacement for formula as the book allegedly recommends pete evans should go from
thinking that they're top dogs we can only hope they botch the next round it's happened before
wow can't help but feel the blondes were robbed
kat should be kicked off for bullying disgraceful behaviour
you don't stretch cold muscles drasko amateur
pete evans a grubby faddist endangering kids lives real palaeolithic babies were breast fed
popped a quick dinner in the oven went and had a shower then sat down to watch i think dinner should be ready now
there's some very hate able teams this year
people choice even better
ash and carmilla are dilly dallying much
time the texan is back baby
longest opening credits ever
yay instant restaurants are over
it's time kitchen hq starts now wa
strategic scoring should have been banned then it would have clearly shown how bad kat and andre really are
we're going camping on or as ash amp camilla would prefer - breakfast for no worries
soggy bread with melted cheese mmmm yumm not
there is only way to stay in the comp cook some good food ouch
gagging at those raw eggs yuk
colin should've called the police over kats dish it was bloody awful bread bacon cheese soup slop
i love how auto rts everything like this even when you say they're frauds
ok so i want the gozleme amp jac amp shaz's pancakes
some yummy camping food on tonight and some not so good food
how intense was tonight's ep
so many tent and pole jokes tonight to make
how the hell does lloyd think that librarians and disneyland ppl would eat meat balls for breakky
i forgot about jac amp shaz i would totally go for their breakfast over fish or eggs cooked in tomato sauce
oh how did kat and andre dodge that bullet fuck colin you had the chance to get them to a cook off and they can't fucking cook
not sure if srs get rid of kat and andre because they're rude horrible mean people they can't cook anyway
i hope annie and lloyd win
bloody kat and andre escape again
it's pretty hard to take seriously as a judge when you know about his nonsense he hates real food
bad luck annie and lloyd your punishment is weeks of camping and cooking outdoors
soggy bread looked disgusting
lol kat and andre are the suckers
kat amp andre are terrible sports
kat and andre
please give annie amp lloyd the arse please
don't celebrate too quick your food was so shit kat and andre
hey kat and andre you served soggy bread suckkkkers rofl
hah suck shit kat amp andre
i guess kat amp andre weren't hugged enough as a child
poor kat hahahaha
kat and andre are horrible people
i'm so sick of kat n andre scraping through by their teeth kick them off the show
oh ffs how do kat and andre continue to scrape through
i would love to eat meatballs next time i'm at the library or disneyland lloyd
what kat and andre are doing is called bullying i hope they're proud of themselves
kat is in disbelief that the camping folk don't like they're sloppy food
it's like teams when all you need is a gun how will i keep up with them all
yeah lloyd people often cook in libraries really in touch with reality buddy
colin bringing the zings to the table
ah annie amp lloyd have created breakfast cardboard
can't get enough of my kitchen rules at the moment
i had to count how many teams there were in the credits with all the rounds i wasn't sure and then they confused me
what kat and andre are doing totally wrong should not be allowed just so they get to stay totally wrong
annie and lloyd vote is it pronounced voite
hi nanny hope everyone loves likes the dishes
wearing matching ralph lauren files should be instant disqualification amp trude
let the best tasting food win
annie amp loyd looks like a rissole
c'mon annie and loyd you can do it hey dad mom and lisa
i know how did they bloody get on this show
could slip into town and grab a carton while these bloody adds are on
someone please high five kat amp andre in the face with a fry pan hard
fricken love mr texas
oooh sudden death will be no surprise
did you mean sudden death they should suffer slowly i would say
fish for breakfast um no thanks maybe lunch but good on them getting crispy skin on a bbq
not really a fan of but would've rather they stayed than
i fucking love ash hahaha
don't wish ill horrible behaviour disappointed you are from wa all the way
yes annie - a pony is on the menu god you are insightful
never cooked on a barbecue before unaustralian
you eat lamb meatballs for breakfast i thought you two ate fairy dust cupcakes with rainbow unicorn muffins
meatballs and bubble and squeak don't make excuses
oh my god seriously pure evil that is not editing it's just plain nasty to make those comments
arbory bar and eatery
hope the campers judge strategically
breakfast bacon x fried eggs toast x sausage tomato mushrooms and spinach
go jac amp shaz love the pancakes they look great
nothing beats bacon when you are camping
breaking was not first audition for kat and andre
do you understand the meaning of karma
oh i get it now immunity on = not having to do the challenge i was wondering where of the teams were
always looking forward to see rob and dave's outfit of the day those shirts
seems legit
where is located tonight
i'm laughing kat and andre laugh at annie and lloyd not doing well and then they completely fail
sheri amp emilie might be ready for lunch might i said
where are the americans and the brits
i'm never gonna finish watching kat and andre's episode haha
most of those people would be hard pressed to find their arse with both hands let alone make it presentable
meatballs and bubble and squeak don't make excuses
who's in sudden death
the pancake people were definitely on the right track that would appeal to adults and more importantly kids
kat the cat and andre make me not wanna follow the show anymore until they are off it anyone agree
the eggs were snot as hubby described them he's right
kat amp andre are about as popular as jake bilardi right now
i envy your ability to straddle the world of reality tv amp high art amp again i ask what are they paying per tweet
i missed the end of to watch what happened
can almost taste that yummy food but i still pick the corn fritters yummo
fritters yes rob and dave sounds delicious
representing on a few of them might need a lesson or two in how to operate the though
great ball handling skills will lloyd from could show you how its done
the boys corn and zucchini fritters are going to kill it
anyone else wants to punch drasco in the head
what is the difference between hot cakes and pancakes
i actually hate the adelaide teams on this year ugh
the boys fritters are going to kill it
why are annie and lloyd cooking that for breakfast
where's manu
rofl crime against cooking good one colin
thank god we've finally got to the point in where it becomes masterchef
if kat amp andre i hope they get kicked out of they are so horrible it's not editing you are just horrid
good lord bianca is so done with this fool
goddamn i really want pancakes now
i do like ash and camilla the have screen presence
switched back to for tonight hope my favourite teams there's about of them do well
so glad colin has a bigger role in the show this season time to change it up
i lurve holidays sauce amp karma
annie and lloyd vs vicky and celine for their first sudden death cook off game on
that's a huge serve of pancakes kids would love that
aaradhna - wake up on
it should have been kat and andre
obviously doesn't believe in slip slop slap they all look sunburnt
it's just loose boiled tomatoes and wet eggs i wouldn't eat that sorry to our adelaide team
annie reminds me of laura from little house on the prairie lol
take that kat amp andre scum of the earth lol i just can't with them
i don't know what goes longer - a ad break or a joke told by that texas dude on
just catching up on tonight's - reckon drasko has a adult attention deficit disorder like living with a man-size toddler
okay you have played with us enough now get rid of all the useless fucks amp get a real cooking comp happening
jac and shaz meal looks really good mum and i want it now
last time i saw something this chaotic long pause somebody ran into a beehive
here's an idea - give them machetes and make it a real sudden death
mmm the pancakes are mouth watering i wish i was there
monday night is going to be a ripper can't wait
teams i hate got crap reviews now are going to sudden death whoever leaves either way i'll be happy
when are the food trucks gonna make a comeback
oh my god colin's polka dot shirt is excellent just excellent
last time i saw something this chaotic someone had run into a beehive in their underwear made of rattlesnake skin
de javu i tweeted at the early stage of that vicky and celine could kill bambi it'll happen next week
kat and andre still being disgusting human beings
where was robert amp lyndsey
how can we wait until monday
see y'all on monday night
the texan is gold
is closed our first sudden death cook off will happen on monday night and there will be chaos and a horror dish
im with booooo
wtf kat and andre were not sent to sudden death
bullshit bullshit
annie lloyd vicki celenie sudden death kat and andre should be up there with them
it's the victorian thing and the fact that they're not kat and andre lets be real here
boom straight into sudden death
and are headed to the st sudden death cook-off monday is sure to bring the drama
love vicky and celine
jac and shaz meal looks really good mum and i want it now
is this series ever going to end
annie exhausted from camping lol
better be vicky and celine victorious
rigged
i actually kinda like ash and camilla when the hell did that happen
camilla is far too picnic at hanging rock for my liking
vicki amp celine our strategy should be kick ass no your strategy should be cook food
camilla is far too picnic at hanging rock for my liking
i honestly don't care who goes home between annie and lloyd and vicky and celine they're both annoying
hoping annie and lloyd do well
yay go cash and manilla
wheres the sudden death cook off how do they die can we get tickets
vicky and celine kickass i hope they do
camilla was like
fuck'en campers voting strategically as well
are they going to sudden debt or sudden death
rt certain its gunna be a death match between kat and andre and annie and lloyd
yeah ash amp camilla
kat we are the best those campers were voting strategically i am the best cook here
ash and camilla is the people's choice their dish were great
pretty sure vicky and celine drop out of the comp entirely
um it's a cooking show - they should have 'seen the best of you' the very first damn dish you ever cooked for them
noooooooooooo those vile cretins survive again
damn it i was hoping kat and andre were in the bottom
sudden death for annie and lloyd maybe they will buy a bbq and practice for next time
dammit not kat andre
congrats ash amp camilla keep it up vic girls
yeah victoria
sudden diabetic coma
wow good on you ash and camila i feel like these guys are good humans who just take the mic now and then
hope vicky and celine leave
it didn't blow my mind it blew my mind and my head colin is no matt preston
gl-amping yes gurl
i seriously think that to perfection has become my absolute least favourite phrase ever uttered in the history of humanity
i would love all the teams breakfast while camping
annie and lloyd are in sudden death no surprise there
wow good on you ash and camila i feel like these guys are good humans who just take the mic now and then
's salmon and hollandaise dish blew colin's mind hair and socks off the campers feel the same way
i'm certain pete has a spittoon for all non-paleo food that he has to taste
where'd all the hats go
ash and camilla yes
pulled it off credit where credit is due well done
colin is doing his best impression of him with his judging lol
yaaay i love ash and camilla
congratulations on peoples choice ash and camilla
well that result feels rigged especially with the amount of people for pancakes
gozlemetastic
some of those meals are so bad there shouldn't even be a cook off
yay ash
drasko would take hr to have a root
i'm so happy for sheri and emilie
ash and camilla smash it yummo
wooooo hoooo my gals ash and camilla win
photo of grandson
my fave too now bring on the yuuuummmm
aww yay ash and camila
that lineup looks like a prison parole parade
ash amp camilla are my favourites and i missed them sorry
if it's a kat and annie showdown the 'sudden death' could be literal
record number of gozleme in one statement
kats the kind of person that would cheat to win and then still think that made her a better cook so my new baddie
boom camilla and ash well done girls you did amazing
so if sherie emilie are not the worst they're safe whew
don't think i have ever seen a nastier piece of work than kat and andre
and kat thought her bake was great so delusional
i'm so happy for sheri and emilie
all kat and andre did was cut up bread and layer it with ham and cheese and they can't even get that right seriously they need to
yay great critique for sheri and emilie go girls
lmao amp andre you don't deserve to be on show you are the worst cpl in history amp most hated your attitude sux
kat's face right now priceless
kat kat kat - who are you going to blame now and without 'strategic' voting your days are numbered
they actually cooked logically for camping josh mum whose name i can't remember
baaarrrbbeeeqquuueee
oh capt salty is smoking something
but is it paleo
we love the idea of a are going down
best thing i have heard rt quote from my other half about kat 'you can tell she's a rough pub mole'
making delish burritos with my boy
hahaahahahhahahahah eat shit kat and andre
so is this going to be a show down between kat and annie
i don't believe in karma but i do like watching it in action
is there an eviction tonight if there's any justice in the world it will be kat and andre who get booted
haha kate wiped the smile off your face too
i really hope that the hocked a few loogies into kat amp andre's mains that would make me smile
might have to eat her words after receiving some not so great feedback on their ham and gruyere dish
sherie amp emilie are
soggy ham n cheese sanga vs shitty meatballs cmon give us a cook off with these front bums
oh god annie and lloyd what the hell
based on the crap served there should be four teams in the cook off
i'm just cringing for the girls whyyyy
do you understand the meaning of karma
kat and andre are such assholes
thanks mkr producers for the brilliant side by side editing there served up some sweet humble pie to kat amp andre
josh amp mum have the right combination adding extra bacon after a request is the perfect touch well done people like free add-ons
please please please can annie and cat feature in an episode of naked amp afraid where they r stranded on an island together
it's game on skulls another beer
haha sucked in kat amp andre
photo of grandson
thank you colin and pete karma kaz and andre
kat's attitude is getting on my nerves
annie and lloyd kat and andre get fucked the lot of ya's
some yummy camping food on tonight and some not so good food
god i hope kats gone soon what are stuck up amp -
the editing on is genius
what the hell were annie and lloyd thinking kat might get their wish of going up against her
fingers crossed kat amp andre go into sudden death - where they belong
and that wipes the smile off your face kat
officially lost any respect for collin that i had left
hahaha suckeeeeers karma's a bitch kat amp andre
i'm loving colin apart of the judging this year he is awesome
the ever charming kat has a moment of humour
can kat repeat the same unbridled joy she had for annie failing towards her own failures
good advice kid to emilie amp sheri you need to wake up earlier too cute
is kat crazy like the joker cruel amp crazy amp clueless
because + minute add breaks are just the best
kat amp andre got a right slap there just wish it was literal vile individuals taking great satisfaction in the negative of others
well now i just hope kat and andre crash and burn - nasty little biscuits
colin is whinging about too much pancakes well i hate unicorns see now we're both complaining about things that don't exist
kat amp andre need to be kicked out
josh amp mum mmmmm yummo
it's like i can feel them all burning in the sun
that's called karma kat
awwwwwwwww suck on that bahahaha hahahahaha
kat in shock and humiliated so enjoyable
quote from my other half about kat 'you can tell she's a rough pub mole'
kat on says what every one else is thinking
yeh laugh again kat
if it's a kat and annie showdown the 'sudden death' could be literal
lol kat's smile gone in less than seconds
vickys job is to stand there and do nothing hereby scaring all the bears away
kat and andre's reaction to annie and lloyd was disgusting they so deserve to be eliminated with extreme prejudice
wow i think kat is the least likeable person ever
ha ha the look on kats face when the judges delivered their critique
kat and andre you are as unpleasant as your cooking
colin's review of kat amp andre is equivalent of a teacher saying well done on writing your name in pencil
boyfriend sudden death is actually literal the teams will have to live on the paleo diet and see who dies first
i remember the top chef contestant doing a japan dumpling soup for cowboys in a camp ground
i've never hated someone laugh so much eh you wished for bad you got hit by terrible
prayer circle that kat and andre will face sudden death
of course annie doesn't do outside she's a redhead
those poor contestants having to camp amp cook for for breakfast camping putting up a tent not staying in a cabin camping yuck
professor snape or colin fassnidge
kandre are such bad sports
thank you colin and pete karma kaz and andre
colin doesn't care if you're cooking on the lake marine parks and wildlife do
kat and andre are so so mean
i feel sorry for the tent
lots of raw food around
thank you producers for making me hate kat so much you have done your job perfectly
how many times does karma have to slap you in the face till you realise you can't cook kat and andre
bubble and squeak or terrible and shit thats the question
insert evil laugh here
oh no annie and lloyd
wow kat amp annie make the perfect horrible couple
bad bad food plain and simple kat
karma i hope it bites kat on the butt she is just nasty
take that kat amp andre scum of the earth lol i just can't with them
when did become
that's karma kat and andre
tbh rooting for jane and emma bc we have that lawyer bond
and you thought annie and lloyds was bad
of course annie doesn't do outside she's a redhead
jesus annie stop fucking grinning like a fool someone tear up a poster of a unicorn in front of her to stop her smiling
toot toot the karma train stopping at kat's station
you jog colin pete can just hurl into his spittoon
oh kat your turn now it was just as bad
yeah kat i wouldn't laugh so hard you are about to be brought back down to earth now who's laughing
that'll wipe the smile of your faces yep now yours is wiped too
in love with ash
why is kat over there looking smug she can't even cook
don't excuse your bad cooking annie and then kat's gloating comes on lol
colin is right cooking is cooking
mmmm is there more to easter than read my blog mmmm
i'll be ready for breakfast by the time this episode is finished
annie and lloyd worst dish of the day if you ask me
i'm with that kid
everything sounds like a dish you want to eat pete because you don't eat fkn food
did i miss something where is adam
of course you are sold out mt isa girls - you put twenty pancakes on each plate
because + minute add breaks are just the best
pancake-gate who's is better
kat and andre annie and lloyd sudden death please
we want big portions
i could give colin a workout just saying
jac shaz dish sounds delish
these ingredient sponsorships are like fukn google ads on my tv
sometimes i don't know what colin is saying
if sheri and emilie go home im not watching the show anymore
bianca is feeling sick she tried the baked greek eggs
lots of raw food around
if the contestants opened a restaurant
i wish they went to death row instead of sudden death
it'd be good if they just had colin and many judging this round
there are more crap dishes than good ones - oh that's right - it's my kitchen rules silly me
pete if you want 'wow' maybe switch networks and head to masterchef mate
love everyone but please don't let sheri and emilie go to sd
where's manu found him with the english boyz
sometimes i don't know what colin is saying
where's manu did i miss something at the beginning of the show
think we can all agree kat and andre will not get people's choice
even lloyd is taking the piss out of annie tonight
bianca deserves a medal cooking with drasko
what state is the campsite in
explained it at the end of last nights show in about minute
by the time we get through it all
wouldn't it nice if annie ends up in sudden death against kat
i always get so hungry watching
i really hope the bottom two are kat amp andre and annie amp lloyd
judgement time
i'm so proud of rose being so proud of josh
colin + pete = too much unlikeableness and orange this season of is leaving a bitter taste in my mouth already
i hope sheri and emilie don't go to sudden elimination please no
it's not sold out when you're giving them away for free
fucking lol crime against cooking hahahahahahahaha
who is gonna win the peoples choice
bring us some pancakes at anytime of the day
they should have made some potato bread and an ulster fry eh colin
kat is super confident that her dish is a winner cut to negative comments i'm so happy
kat and andre's redemption episode catchup - attempt
ready to run love the music choice good luck everyone
blech on the raw eggs should have just left it to cook longer
so many poor dishes it will be hard to choose who to put into sudden death
annie's reaction when lloyd said disney land is why i hate her
there were top teams from ea round amp didn't top their round amp are also safe
how good would sudden death be with annie amp lloyd vs kat amp andre
this time im ready to run
if sherri amp em go to sudden death they'll nail it bounce back
hoping vicky and celine to go sudden death
delusional twits who can't cook even when surrounded by cookbooks
too many bad dishes tonight it's gonna be a fight for the bottom
food poisoning
you don't suck sheri and emilie hell no they rock
capt salty's list of what she is ever expanding
how the fuck do you fuck up breakfast not surprising for people who mess up a dish they've cooked a million times
it's a dish that could appeal to the public the moronic ignorant public that don't eat a paleo diet - pete
woooo hooooo o just so awesome of to play it
why didn't any of the teams serve up cold pizza as a breakfast item
never thought i'd feel bad for but that episode got me right in the feels and now i feels like punching andre
no idea what's going on note to self don't start watching a show midway through
yummi yummie yummie i like this where's mine
disneyland or a library
you've undercooked eggs and probably poisoned small children i'd be exhausted too
since when can you get a car anywhere near the basin
blech on the raw eggs should have just left it to cook longer
go colin he's actually showing a sense of humour all you need is some personal grooming and i might like you
this challenge is really separating the good cooks from the bad
how good would sudden death be with annie amp lloyd vs kat amp andre
kat vs annie in sudden death please
these outside challenges tend to separate the genuine competition contenders from the rest of the teams
you haven't actually sold out if you're not charging for the food though you have sold out metaphorically
where the weetbix
rose and josh are one of my favourite teams on
going out for breakfast tomorrow or it would be pancake fest in my kitchen
dont be disheartened emilie n sherri
normally when kat amp andre go to campgrounds it's so they can enjoy some dogging
pete doesn't like kat and andres dish hopefully that means they're on sudden death
mmm taste that bandaid flavour
oh god i love colin
why does pete evans get to decide what breakfast food is
pete's palate is a sentient being and it's confused
where can i vote for colin to win the gold logie
a lot of people would like to put kat to sudden death
perhaps you could have turned the black side down on the pancakes
where's manu did i miss something at the beginning of the show
normally when kat amp andre go to campgrounds it's so they can enjoy some dogging
classic colin crime against cooking hahaha
walter jnr from would love the variety of breakfasts
me either
colin's in good form tonight
spoiler alert it won't be you lloyd
i can't believe people are still surprised that annie and lloyd can't cook
oh thanks god people i don't hate
if ash wins her hair will stand on end oh wait
yumm mushrooms the bacon of vegetables
prob not breakfasting the paleo diet pete but it's right up there with pizza in my breakfast book
judges comments are so funny
where are the food police colin needs to call
burnt rissoles for breaky it's a crime against cooking
bottom teams i'm thinking kat and andre and annie and lloyd
yes they were one of the top teams and were safe
i'd rather have gozleme for breakfast instead of a plate of sugary pancakes
great to see the local national park workers tucking into a free feed how about you empty those loo's instead
who cooks in a library insanity
love that kat and andre think they are doing well but are getting slated by the campers
where the hell are debra amp eva what did you do with them i want answers
i like my meatballs as much as the next guy but would not eat them in a library
fingers crossed it tastes good cut to punter it tastes like cardboard
with annie amp lloyd and celine amp vicky representing sa can you all now understand why we are the serial killer capital of the world
cooking in a library or disneyland annie and lloyd are absolutely bonkers
that maple bacon w scrambled egg and toasted sourdough bread - rosie's order for tomorrow's breakfast done
i would pay money to see celine and the mother eliminated
fucking lol crime against cooking hahahahahahahaha
an annie lloyd vs kat andre elimination cook off would be oh god please let this happen
lip reading coming in handy
disneyland really
i don't think those meatballs would do any better in a library or in disneyland or any place really
how dare you give me free food i don't like - asshole campers
there are more crap dishes than good ones - oh that's right - it's my kitchen rules silly me
colin is such a dag i actually love him i said i wasn't gonna watch anymore but colin
can kat and andre go already
oh no disneylands going down
i'm sure opening the bbq to let all the hot air out will make it cook faster
'it's a crime against cooking' the shade
i think colin might not be a fan of the meatballs
annie and lloyd crime against cooking
we have a surprise for you is it a pony oh fuck off
yum concrete balls for brekky
'there's a police boat over there - this is a crime against cooking' - ok i fully approve now of colin being a judge
i wish robert was my dad i could listen to his stories all day
i need a sleeping bag as well cause this show boring as fuck
colin eating
guy with the cap and pete said bye kat and minion
there are some annoying idiots in this competition
hold the phone kat amp andre cook crap again and think its amazing
annie amp lloyd are actually ridiculous
all the food looks delicious i want to be a camper now
pete couldn't eat the whole plate the plates are not made from bone broth and chicken oils
pete eating
i've always liked pete
safe option colin ur a d ck no is going to cook a michelin star menu for breakfast for campers
more bad cooking from kat and andre
my daughter thinks those blueberry pancakes look amazing
want to play marbles kids go see annie and lloyd
with petes so called paleo diet i call bs bs bs on him eating amp swallowing wheres the bin
karma karma karma
after watching celine and her mother cook i've decided to avoid greek food like the plague
kat andre breakfast looks raw
stuff that - just buy the dam tortillas and make the breakfast absolutely delicious not points for making your own in my eyes
how do you screw up cooking bread in a cooking competition
i've missed you robert and lynzey
um there are a few teams missing
the gozleme looks delicious good work lovelies
i love little kid 'foodies'
really annie a pony how can it fit in there
pancakes all the way hands down winner
wasn't watching the screen and briefly thought colin was manu doing a bad aussie accent
but marge i'm missing the chili cook off
i feel like making pancakes
can the kid that said yummy yummy yummy get a
camilla is back show us ya norks
favourite and cutest review so far yummy yummy yummy
is this the same day
come on jac and shaz
pancakes a winner with the kids
victorian teams are doing well naturally
so glad to see all the other teams back it's like one big happy family
shaz is not getting enough airtime
hey pete maybe what those kids need is some liver milk
of course the salmons fucking popular does that crowd look like the type of people who would actually buy salmon
omg mkr is on
im soo hungry to bad there is no chicken
sorry vicki and celine but ur baked eggs and tomato dish looks more like an abortion
minute add breaks bloody cheeky
i've just worked it out bearded rob sounds exactly like joe mangel from neighbours
the mother and son team are sooooo nice
raw egg sorry but you aren't serving breakfast to rocky
seriously if men at work can be sued for the kookaburra rift then should be able to retire after taking to court
nikky amp celine together with kat is my bet
dump the grotty guy bring back manu
good on you ash and camila
no wonder pete is always in a bad mood it must be hard to eat bad food all the time
that looks bad
meanwhile back in the english boyz tent
fkn hell you just had to go and say it another times
im getting soo hungry too bad there is no chicken
i feel like pancakes now and it
those meatballs are so wrong definitely not a breakfast meal
there's a cave nearby where colin keeps his stuff
amp are the strongest contenders so far will the campers agree with the judges
mmmmm raw egg
rob amp dave are in their element
yes bacon for breakfast what a terrible idea
can't wait to see the winners
when you're cooking for the public a safe option is a good option you want more people eating voting
c'mon shelli and emilie get something out
isn't that the point pete appeal to the public
maple bacon yum
looks delish love jane and emma's hotcake dish it looks to good to eat through the television
we're in our element serving food we've cooked which turned out a whole lot better than plan a serving food someone else had cooked
what are kat and andre even serving doesn't look sound appealing at all
who gets your vote can we vote for more than one
lamb meatballs for breakfast wtf
bloody ads - i read about tweets in the ad break
yay emilie and sherri are serving
lucky adam isn't involved in this challenge he'd hate the thought of feeding children
just flicked onto someone is claiming they are serving up food that they cooked what did i miss
as opposed to serving up food that other people have cooked
and yes i'm still watching
i feel bad for annie and lloyd should've made something with bacon
did that nandos advert really just happen
meatballs aren't even a breakfast meal worst decision ever
i would eat annie amp lloyds food i eat steak for breakfast mmm amp lloyd
lucky adam isn't involved in this challenge he'd hate the thought of feeding children
cheeseymite rolls of some sort with coffee
i really want a hot cake
can't handle kat amp andre on all talk i think i'll just follow along on social media until they crash and burn like all crack addicts
i don't understand how people don't like vicki and celine they're my kind of people although i'm also from sa so it might explain it
based on scores annie amp lloyd vs sheri amp emile based on personalities kat amp andre vs fuck it you're out
it took her ages to learn after she escaped from roswell
go rob and dave do it for the boys
i reckon rob and dave could serve shit on a stick and those scabs i mean campers would eat anything
twitter always ruins shows like and because i'm behind time
i don't know what that song is on that house rules ad is but it's fucking woeful and it makes me want to go on a murderous
but marge i'm missing the chili cook off
based on scores annie amp lloyd vs sheri amp emile based on personalities kat amp andre vs fuck it you're out
they're 'immune' for being top scorers in their round - i think teams are so not cooking this time
meanwhile back in the english boyz tent
jac and shaz's pancakes look delicious
i'm with manu if camping was involved i wouldn't show up either
a few teams have been caught out by the time and volume requirements i would aim for servings and something tasty with cheese
cant believe they haven't put out one gozleme epic fail
for the next lunch challenge annie amp lloyd will be making a bowl of cornflakes with hash browns
good breakfast ideas with vegetables vegetable fritters with fresh corn yum
mmmmm maple bacon how can you go wrong
c'mon sheri and emilie you can do this i can't see you in sudden death
i really want hotcakes and pancakes so bad
kid - you have to wake up earlier lol
so happy to hear playing ready to run by made my day
i keep looking for rob lynzey amp debra eva but they're safe right
drasko is at it again i'm surprise she doesn't back hand you seriously
ha ha love that little kid saying you need to wake up earlier
no that kid is just a brat
the girls should realise it's what you print on the plate and not the food that sells
i usually love lloyd's shirts but annie's shirt today is just adorbs
kat and andre make me want to hurt myself
i've just realised that annie reminds me of one of the replicants in bladerunner
don't go bacon my heart i couldn't if i fried
definitely out of unless you're kat and andre then it's a solid and strategic out of
what is going on with ems amp shez sudden death beckons
is it just us or is turning into meets
hope the greek 'ladies' are in the hottest bodies issue
are the hungry campers looking like happy campers we're feeling the stress on tonight
mmmmm maple bacon how can you go wrong
annie and lloyd are going down to sudden death town
feeling a whole lot of gozleme pain for sherri amp em
i'm so hungry for bacon
let's see what ash and camilla are up to
can't ask campers to wait for breakfast gotta give them what they want and now
kat everyone loves it cut to i didn't like it
u would think after the last so many seasons of they would learn to cook something easy but yummy
it looks like there are quite a few asian campers there someone should have made congee
no never
i've never liked maple syrup with bacon it ruins two great ingredients
where is this place
annie and lloyd wonder why no one is lining up who the eff eats meatballs for breakfast
annie amp lloyd are serving leftover dinner for breakfast why
come on qld
i feel like breakfast
gozleme is taking way too long
omg i hope sheri and emeli don't go to sudden death
so many of these breakfasts sound amazing i wouldn't be able to make up my mind if i was there - bacon
poor sheri and emilie
who the hell would want meatballs for breakfast unless you're recovering from a killer hangover
minutes to the next bake yeah okay
cat n andre can't cook - why the hell r they on the show
where is this place it's beautiful
omfg min amp sherrie emilie have nothing out
she can't hear you you little troll
feeling sooo hungry give me some of those pancakes
i'd eat those fritters and bacon looks awesome
i feel like breakfast
no
english isn't kats first language right
i keep looking for rob lynzey amp debra eva but they're safe right
kat and andre's breakfast fails the would qantas serve this in economy class test
gozleme and pancakes available and his is why australia is the best country in the world - eat up its all good
there's one word to remember - bacon bacon bacon not fricken lamb meatballs bacon with maple syrup
bacon to keep the happy smart
rob and dave better win this bacon
i would have done spicy mexican eggs with bacon amp roasted capsicum
where is the location of tonight's
bloody love josh amp rose
maybe someone will use kat's weber
now i'm hungry for those blueberry hotcakes omg gimme gimme
we ran out of tortiers
some of these contestants are idiots who eats meatballs in the morning
should've gone for the sliced pony after all annie
annie and lloyd have an epiphany
that's hangover food you nuffers annie and lloyd
there's the people who go reality tv to be someone and then there's the people who hang around set to eat free food and be on
poor annie the kids are scared of her
ash amp camilla are so ab fab
it's all free as if they're going to turn it down
madwoman fritters i see
spotted sound guy drinks
we're serving leftovers for breakfast
it's like left over roast veggies marketing isn't lloyd's strong point
kat and andre sudden death in fact take the to the iron maiden
should've cooked more than cheese bake hopefully this means sudden death for them
why on earth would bubble amp squeak be considered appealing when you eat out it's leftovers i can do that myself and i'm a crap cook
bahahahaha oh my god that was amazing to be honest i didn't like it hahaha
who cares abt coffee with so much yummy food
step away from the kat kids for your own safety
annie and lloyd's dish is a bit of a balls up a lamb balls up
gruyere is way too fancy - very rich and not something many kids will enjoy
go jac n shaz looks great
c'mon girls get the gozleme on i want them safe
haaaa please let kat andre go to sudden death
meatballs for breakfast not really a breakfast item saying that though i'd eat them
i think maybe the hat is turning people off
come on sheri and emilie you guys can do it
karma is coming back to bite annie and lloyd
c'mon emilie n sherri you guys are the best
glamping calm your hair
yeaahhh bubble and shit for breakfast great choice
no one wants lloyd's balls except annie poor lloyd
meatballs in the morning would be the problem
no one wants bubble amp squeak for breakfast jfc
if the ranger's eating breakfast who's looking after the park
go ash and carmella they should cook my breakfast
isn't raw egg in tomato poured onto a plate better than nothing no just no
jac and shaz
always good to sell your food by calling it 'left over food' genius lloyd
puntastic colin
our pancakes are selling like hotcakes shaz - yes yes they are jac we wish we could sample some
poor sheri and emilie feel so bad for them
whats ja'mie doing in
poor annie and lloyd
come on sheri and emilie i have all the faith in the world girls
if emilie leaves tonight i'm out okay maybe not but i'll be shattered
where are the pop-tarts
worried for the gozleme girls
i don't want waiting bwahahaha
geez how many family members of vicky amp celine are at that camp site
nah mate don't care what they give me as long as it's free
maple bacon wins every time
pre dessert an ad for contestants was just on tv boyfriend immediately downloads the online application
half the people rushing forward had knives and jousting sticks aimed at kat
poor sheri and emilie - i want to help them
if it takes so long to make then why did you bother
celine amp vicky for elimination
we hope those gozlemes are worth the wait girls
pancakes look nice
celine ate all the ice cream little kid
game on hungry campers
why did no one do cold pizza for breakfast it's always a favorite
so many good looking dishes and also a few bad ones too
salmon for breakfast wtf
do you think for each of these cook offs they get help from anyone with their choice of dish they will cook
helloooh camperes hi de hi
it's free food seriously they don't care
maple bacon wins every time
i'm actually finding myself shutting down internally every time kat talks
i'd be happy with a perfect bacon and egg roll
well you are not really serving plates lets face it unless some guts is going to get breakfast from all of you
i hope there's a lot of portaloos at that campsite
maple bacon come at me
breakfast is served which team would you be heading for
water police to tent eggmergency
someone should have served chicken liver blended baby food guaranteed a right there
my face every time i hear or see kat hope it don't get stuck
bro i am so pro i can cook minute noodles
what's the difference between a pancake and hot cake
please nobody make a celine = elephant comment fat jokes are not classy sizeism sucks hate her bogan-ness not her dress size
great 'shot a deer in my underwear' joke robert now tell us the one about the guy with a wooden leg named smith
celine
the fritters look good only one problem every one else's meals look like a train wreck in paradise to me
where's the bloody marys
standby for people becoming sick from the dodgy eggs bad hollandaise and stupid puns
the american pancakes look yum so does that maple bacon
when exactly did they plan these menu's back at kitchen hq or in the car on the way to coles
why has really done downhill it's not the same anymore
why do i think jacs really still has no idea where she is or what's she's doing there
they're at the basin on pittwater across from palm beach nsw
this episode is so much fun nak ada kat situ jugak
pony burgers from annie with diazepam sauce
loving this challenge

pancakes are proof that there is a deity and they love us
mmmmm maple bacon
mmmm what are your fave dumplings love chinese worldwide mmmm
so many delicious breakfast dishes i would seriously struggle to pick one
it's clear who the thinkers are

i cant believe vicky and celine didnt just make fully sick fish and chips vre
ohh celine what are you doing no snotty eggs
jane got didn't she why are they participating in this thing

meatballs to die for and bacon to cry for
wait where are will and steve i've missed a few episodes now that u have mention it where r they

urrrggg going to be a lot of hungry campers going to maccas for breakfast
loving the look of the fritters
annie is coated in + sunscreen

those eggs were nowhere near ready
i still can't believe that katie and nikki are out seriously oops prob shouldn't say that totes awkward lol
how can you have never cooked on a bbq before
lols raw egg
i thought pete was camp enough for anyone
everyone looks tired
raw egg is this rocky iv
lloyd and drasko think camping is going to be easy for them i mean people have being calling them camp for years
i'm tipping the salmon will be overcooked because the bbq is too hot
jac n shaz pancakes have us wishing it was breakfast now
i thought the posh girls were annoying but i'd rather be stranded on island with them than say a word to kat amp her minion
if your benchmark for success is team greek next door then you're always going to be feeling confident
go to your happy place
one thing's certain - we're pretty sad we won't get to sample the bbq breakfasts which team would you head over to first
drasko playing with his pork who would have thought
anyone think kat amp andre are being completely lazy with their meal guess what happens when you cheat your way in
tongs for the memories campers
i would say josh take your top off but i feel like we'd be underwhelmed
umm annie they arnt meatballs
if kats food is under cooked or burnt i'm going to laugh my ass off
why didn't they just make bacon and eggs
i really don't want to hear the boys say let's pitch a tent
if something is so hard to do on the bbq then why why why do it
can someone tell me where to find when are cooking for the public i want some
i love it
christ those look amazeballs
vegemite on toast would gave been good
drasko the pork ninja mind boggling
this is really drasco
just shot a piece a garlic across my flat in an attempt to peel it still a better cook than kat
i would love for to turn up to my campground and cook breakfast
who hasn't cooked on a bbq before

ehh it's the boring stage now
wadhwa thinks women only disagree vocally with him because they want attention
wadhwa had other women write a book about being a woman in tech then he published it with his own name on the title
wadhwa only cares about wadhwa - not women in tech
wadhwa is like most male allies who use women's suffering for their own financial amp career advancement
hell yeah awesome post on wadhwa
totally forgot how that jerk invited me up to his office too lol no my time is worth too much
this oblivious meltdown is in response to women who dared to speak up against him
orly -- gt i have done more for the cause of women in tech than almost anyone
have been traveling barely managing cfps blogs out of the question
wadhwa started contacting journalists that follow me on twitter to tell them how disappointed he is in them
wondering if there would be value in refusing to answer inquiries provide quotes for press that insists upon quoting wadhwa
on one hand he could get quoted more but some reporters will look pretty dumb if all their women in tech stories are about dudes
i've ran into difficulties getting them to respond which is weird their news orgs have written stories about me in the past
i am a woman in tech vivek wadhwa does not speak for me
because he is developing ties to gamergate relies on their support talks to milo
because he follows a pathetically low amount of female engineers but he's cool with female reporters
you can just do that with twitter search unless you are looking to not block manually ez enough to write though
methinks this guy has a bit of a ego bit rt i have done more for the cause of women in tech than almost anyone
the best thing could do for women in tech is leave them the hell alone creeper
watching claim that he never received financial compensation oh sweets we know this isn't how that works
money is the smallest part of success in tech it's about accomplishment connections and rep - all of which wadhwa hides from women
yeah i've got a bit of a rageboner mentally speaking
never
i'm not a shark i'm the tree behind the shark
but that tree is a creeper look at it look into its eyes
my name is randi lee harper harper lee is trending coincidence
i haven't heard anything about it but i can keep my eyes open
sad thing is that women in tech debate is becoming radicalized people with personal agendas beginning to dominate pushing out
the lack of self-awareness from right now is staggering and hilarious
personal agendas like
yeah women in tech is becoming radicalized because men are losing ground on it the horror
i am a woman in tech and i do not want to speak for me i have him blocked so he won't creep on
hahahaha people in gamergate are now trolling - i so called this
there is a line between being a ally and appropriation rejecting feedback from those you represent makes the line a gulf
today's socks so perfect
the data raises interesting points on trust in a network it's gross to see ob
stalk aka respond to a blog post he made about me after id forgotten all about him
expanding o o
shingy
i'd shopped off the website before
please take a moment to give your support to gamergate is mobbing her game on steam green light ethics
re that sexist newsweek article newsweek wasted space that could've gone to a woman who might have made useful comments
the account is literally retweeting himself talking for women in tech seriously look at it
also used his book account to rt criticism i sent to his personal acct - then blamed an intern
thought it was odd that implied an annual event then i read the guy's tweets oy
how is that related to wadhwa
ah hah
fuck errything about brietbart
perfection
oh wait wasn't someone from valve at the sjw dinner last night i kid but that would be quite amusing if it had happened totally didn't
i just want to hear the screams of collusion
does it matter
at this point you know it's getting mobbed by harassers with down votes aplenty choice is yours
that's pretty not useful and not helpful explain
ah

closing arguments today in the silk road trial and are on it
wait esports are excluding trans and lesbian players jesus christ can we go one fucking day without the industry being r
the actual rule is you are allowed lesbian and or trans player per -player team which is much worse
if there were lesbians there would be no gaming only makeouts obviously can't speak for trans
this is like vegan powers right
also i just found out about this what in andraste's name is this nonsense
lgbt players are welcome at official lol tourneys we're working with partners to ensure consistency with our values across
seeing these cute women in my tl tweeting about how they are into chicks amp i just want to be the most unsmooth person ever like hey
so many jokes
i'm a shark but you're super cute too
not for much longer
i'm visiting my moms house and she's all why are you laughing i don't know how to explain this
you really think i'm a sexy shark
lgbt too powerful pls nerf

reminder nerd dinner tweetup tonight at pm crossroads mall in redmond wa 's welcome
will be there just late as usual
i fucking love her she is hot as shit
white women who need to ally for black women more
no one is perfect we all make mistakes and then we have to apologize for them celebrities aren't special
is not the vast majority
quick kiss a boy and show me your birth certificate
all this because i taunted him over his follower cnt back in sep
gamergate = youtube comments as a service
pause in horror as you realize the harsh reality of that statement
i'm not going to comment on if cernovich bought his followers we don't know it's speculation
he stated in the past that people had bought him followers to try to get his account in trouble
yes a lot of his followers are bots we have known this this isn't news
but saying that he did this is not okay we don't know we will probably never know don't be like them
it's cool don't worry about it
vivek wadhwa is the carrot top of academic sources

what the everliving fuck nd from top

people are spending money to try to get you temporarily suspended from twitter that may be the most was
someone is paying money to get reported to twitter twitter what is the sjw version of
lol even their promoted tweet has a slur in it oh gamergate
i cannot stop laughing
i am so tempted to not contact twitter just so they can spend more money on promoting my twitter handle
by the way i was just hanging out with somebody from github talking about their decision to remove gamergate's accounts for harassment
last rt people are actually paying money to promote an ad for twitter to suspend who made the gg autoblocker

a random scientist that keeps blogging about me a sexist asswipe that told me to not bother with my projects coz he did it

woke up to see revolution pc is ranked th steam greenlight games in hours this is amazing thank you
the list of companies for the anti-abuse round table i'm building is growing i'm excited the world needs this
if you're a company in sf that has an abuse community dept or person this is something you want to be a part of hit me up randi io
purpose of this group is to share the types of abuse seen talk about how to deal with it and diff policy changes tools that are needed
possibly want to see how this evolves internet video conf may become a thing
i woke up to this little stalker sitting in my lap staring at me
i'm only one person
is this who uses msn
i'm sure but i don't know them personally and this is what my soon to be npo does i'm not signing off on some rando
it's official the fcc will motion to have the internet filed under title ii as a utility
gaters trigger too many false positives he would lose his valid follower base
i am going to smack down anyone i see bitching about how cernovich bought his followers you're spreading unsubstantiated rumors not cool
i don't care what bs cernovich has done have some goddamn ethics for real though
continuing to spread those rumors is basically the same thing as gaters saying i was arrested for drugs
you might want to take this to whoever your person at twitter is
noted although this is tricky - what's it going to accomplish another suspended gater account
i think i'm going to push it to people outside of safety so we can get some better promotion reviews
complained early on that people bought him followers to get his acct suspended
perhaps but regardless tools to remove bots would remove gaters
sitting here and spreading unsubstantiated rumors is a shit move though we aren't gaters
my wife co-founded pyladies the best thing i've done for gender diversity was to let women speak

once upon a time in a land far far away in the great state of georgia yours truly worked with
we parted ways but stayed in touch throughout the years he got swole while i went off and did my thing writing perl angering trolls
this brings us to today when the hero of this story was on a bus near uga listening to his podcasts doing his thing
when he hears blue haired bitch gamergate and freebsdgirl oh dear
words were said the gaters protested free speech - alas speech may be free but not of consequences
given that my friend is quite fit and these gaters were not they quickly departed at the next stop instead of debating further
take heed gaters you're alone in the world in your campaign of hate people will stand up to you men and women will stand up to you
lrt did not appear to be snark o o pretty sure dude was serious

btw my alt twitter accounts are and
a kickstarter is tempting but i'm just so weird about money i still feel kind of squick about my patron tbh blame foss mentality
i have so many ideas and so little time even doing this full time of what i'm doing is talking to people
i'm slowly finding people that i trust but it's all so hard because i care so much
not yet i should

i'm still at the stage where i've given up on finding a good task list mgt app that fits with my workflow so i use a
it is not a block bot it is a tool to share block lists this particular one being generated via the api and comparisons ffs
i will burn the building down
i have a whiteboard and a mental list that i run through several times a day i don't know pm stuff yet
maybe i should put together a press kit what is a press kit how do i build one
i think so
are the responses bad i've got the block list enabled so i see nothing
yeah this is more activist specific less time talking to press more time writing code
i think women in general have issues talking about money for activism lots of articles on this
i've read many of them but it doesn't make it easier for me
i wanted to show my mom her ted talk mom saw the search results and started to get what the fuss was about

is that weird am i doing the right thing it feels so pseudo-celeb
st videos when i searched anita sarkeesian angry rants attacking exposing anita femf
i'm not important the things i'm working on are the people helping me push this are i don't want the message being warped to be about me
right i love yelling about things i don't like but now people are listening and it's this weird responsibility
hehe that was actually super helpful i'm saving for later so i can review and think about it
yes i'm like i have no idea what i am doing most of the time if i'm an inspiration we're all fucked
sure shoot me an email randi io
i was never a part of that
i would hate to have you bug your parents for their credit card
patron
i get + a day mostly from indian people no clue why
omg pothead stepdad with ms is a sweetheart but i might kill him if he stumbles one more time through this living room where i'm sleeping
he is not all there and i guess he keeps forgetting that the dog just went outside and ughhhh i want to sleep
lol i remember - watch out she's full gamergate nuts
wrote me the most hilarious open letter that was all about her i loled for days forgot all abt that until now
and then she kept sending all these weird threats my way like wicked witch of the west style
wtf does identity-sure mean i've never heard this but it makes it sound like she thinks trans are confused
at this rate i'm going to be making slides for a keynote in my car as i drive home
what is seen cannot be unseen
oh weird i'm surprised it didn't offer twitter
uh yeah he's my stepdad thanks for the call out though
weeeee that's what i get for grumping joking about a family member random internet rage
and what a judgmental ass you are kindly go fuck yourself
a one time donation is still very appreciated i'll give them that feedback though
i am allergic to cats but thanks anyways
well that makes sense
it sure is weird how i only ever see mean things being attached to the gamergate hashtag
can't tell if sarcasm or clueless
leave it to gg to think women need to compete for the attention of men haven't you listened to bey's flawless gawd
i do a search on my name prefacing this - i come in peace
you should be able to criticize me as long as it isn't abusive people may argue but criticism is important
it's difficult sometimes and not always well received when under heavy attack sometimes i just can't tell what's a troll
but those tweets worry me i don't want people thinking that and i'm not sure how to fix it
if you have ideas i'd love to hear them all i know how to offer is - if you get lots of shit let me know
indeed some people are perhaps a bit more protective in that regards than i would like
it helps remembering how many eyes are watching - not gg but msm people i admire companies the npo depends on me
ugh no kidding i miss being able to be an asshole terrible as that is i still let it out but everything in moderation
oh good lord if only i had that kind of patience
not your shield she said as she literally turned herself into their custom built ideal anime girl mascot
i was a public speaker for a long time knowing how to deal with children would have been an asset
i wrote a tool so people wouldn't have to listen to their hate filled rants
i think i need to get back to sleep now but thanks for having this talk with me
no
lol
i sure am hungry for some scrambled eggs
got a mention in arstechnica via
juxtaposition
from the looks of my twitter feed this morning made herself relevant for the first time in yrs by saying something majorly fucked up
anyone have a video of this
i love misty mornings at blizzard
not sure
a cis ww celeb millionaire rosie who claims to interview people cannot handle questions on her exploitative upcoming guest e
and rosie resorted to saying bully because that's what entitled ww do meanwhile lauren had solid info backed questions no
+ lauren's name defended misuse of chief to an indigenous woman critiquing settler colonialism then she insulted aura amp
+ in the fact that she is queer and a survivor so to rosie racism settler colonialism exploitation by ensler is ok b c ros
and white people who bring up queerness or being a survivor as a way to silence woc because no woc are queer none survivors
this isn't about rosie defending buddy ensler ultimately it's about worldview itself being challenged clearly has never ha
clearly rosie has never had to think about ww as oppressors as settler colonialists as can be harming even while viewing se
because anyone else would've at least answered lauren's questions or say they'd look into the critiques of ensler's work
i like to think that feminists can do feminism however they want i don't judge but if your feminism shits on woc it's not feminism
feminism should be inclusive what rosie is doing just blows my mind weaponizing feminism against woc holy crap
happened on twitter called a bully for pointing out violence against woc in eve enslers wo
oh dear lord
i checked the piano but i don't even fucking put men in here
you big government anti-freedom fucks are why i am in favour of fat shaming
the markov bots are on a roll this morning
twitter ebooks on github
i'm waiting for one but mostly i'm watching the timelines of those involved
my favorite part of this trip has to be all the amazing new socks
write enough puppet code and you have the basics for ruby just to give the sit
you could just start an ebooks account just so i had more shit to argue with
top kek
when i get home i have million emails to answer
i was planning on stopping by portland again but i don't think i'm going to have the time for that too much to do when i get
i'll likely be back up in the pnw for conference season
i submitted for cfp while i was at a bar hopefully i get accepted
he won't stop staring at me
sorry i didn't get a chance to stop by i would've loved to but i ended up having to go home quicker than i thought
you don't understand the things i would do for a waffle house right now
yes
blasphemy
possibly
states should not let unvaccinated crumb-snatchers into schools and the best part it's legal if they don't
i investigated gamergate's latest conspiracy theory and as expected it's full of half-truths and nonsense
well done
to the fda everyone transgender is a gay man
the number of emails attributing my rts of woc racial issues to spoiled white girl guilt is now greater than
yay a new reason for people to hate me shove off
it's called being an ally pissants pay attention you might learn something
gross
i'm watching getting interviewed on huffpost live about and of course she starts with

overwatch review from blizzard doesn't just announce games now they announce universes
if you want to report rogue for doxxing and harassing people use the report to kickstarter link at the bottom https
send kickstarter these
we're being honest with each other rogue is way too busy harassing people to even start working on a game
this ks isn't for a game it's to sponsor his online abuse
i'm not down with tactics like that especially since i'm launching a ks later
until it happened to us not cool
we aren't gamergate we don't do shit like this
the level of transference and tone deafness on this one is amazing
the speech they never told me about
yeassssssss
mayyyybe is there a cfp i've done some neat stuff with statsd graphite and abuse metrics
devopsing for social activism is pretty rad stuff
is it true that if women ran the world we'd all still be living in echo chambers

a friend's facebook acct might get shut down because their legal name isn't the name they use are known by anyone at fb know
shoutout to back when gamergate thought forking 's repo excessively would make me renounce open source
shoutout to that dude that tried to blackmail me with releasing the source code for if i didn't take the project down
yup
dictating tweets is the worst
shoutout to the time when someone forked made changes and gamergate thought i did it because they didn't understand github
i think that last tweet got confused because i started laughing halfway through it
i think the apple uses bsd without compensating you one is still my favorite
shoutout to all those people that emailed freebsd thinking that they were my employer oh wait that's still happening
last but not least shoutout to those guys on the bus in georgia that were talking shit until they ran after being confronted by my friend
github shut them down

well balls
i am the only person crazy enough to currently be on the roads in this weather but i have a keynote to write goddamnit
i can see a little waves of water crashing over the road the car is rocking in the wind had to pull over again
nothings broken i was just driving througg a lot of water
northern california just before oregon
in the past minutes i have seen the grand total of three cars
i was constantly using the system it's off now
yreka still alive
it's off now it was just continuously engaged for a very long time the water here is crazy
oh yeah car well ur face has no traction
fml

i hear that it's snowing up north glad i made it through that before the snow started
i don't know what an atmospheric river is but it does feel like i'm driving in one
miles when i get home i'm watching twister
made it out of the mountains alive
leo was freaking out because of the wind so i buried him in luggage so he could sleep
i got him one of those but it didn't seem to hold him tight enough
yup
what happened this time
repeatedly calling a woman a bitch from the stage was just part of the crunchies' problems with women
is gamergate finally eating its own tail
leo status still zonked out
hours
miles of nothing but farmland in either direction here stands a lone palm tree california
it's so random
i never would've guessed
every day i find it harder and harder to tell you and apart
qq harder because you just lost the game
hi i'm currently in the middle of driving home but i should be there soon will send you an email later
so harsh
richmond police just made a kissyface it leo

well aren't you a prize creep the answer's no by the way
this whole harper lee thing kind of grosses me out so her sister died and it sounds like everybody is taking advantage of her
i don't really understand why everybody seems so okay with that
it seems to me that if she had really wanted this book published it would've been published by now this whole story seems so bunk
why are we letting them just take advantage of this little old lady whom by many accounts is senile
that's just it though it's not even a book it's the rejected first draft of to kill a mockingbird befor
finally home
my patreon is acting weird just got a monthly payment yay but when i go to how i get paid it says i need to become a creator

it is just short of paying my rent after all fees so i can't complain though it's doing better than i thought it would
it really feels like the dm can be the hand-on-the-knee of social communication
first i noticed the misogyny but then i realized - plz brush your teeth
i think we should have a public debate with and a woman in tech topic why should speak for women
i want to see this but storify is returning error code
yo ladies i think it's time we sit down as a group and talk about google hangouts broadcasted
i want a panel of women in tech tearing this shit up
really tho i kind of just want to drain a glass of wine and rant about things that i don't like but i can do that anytime
also - i'm thinking that another sjw party may be happening soon perhaps after gdc
generally anytime you say devil's advocate it means you're wasting people's time and being an ass especially arguing points
that no one has contested it's an old and tiresome trick used by trolls and pseudo-feminists all the time
my personal facebook is not ever a place to debate that i'll unblock but please don't do that again
jfc
that person sounds like a moron i like to find people like that and shit on them
no worries i block quickly from my facebook - the notifications go to my phone unlike twitter but always willing to unblock
i'm an engineer yrs exp and i get mansplained career advice by dudes with the xp and bad life decisions
i'd have to have a space for it and chances are by now most people already have their schedules booked
i have been raging at him for uh months i think ever since innovating women
he didn't worry about me back then since then i've been published everywhere he's trying to discredit
i really wish i had the time to dig more into su - financials and such seems basically cxo circlejerk
sigh he accused me of racism for what i have no idea
whelp i'm starting to get a pretty decent platform i'm going to get his face out there alright
the anti-abuse thing is my main focus always but in my spare time his bullshit is abusive towards feminism
bahahaha
cc
if he really wanted to ally he'd get his dudebros to change - not tell women how to fit in with dudebros
i am probably not answering email tonight i have other work to catch up on this weekend = = gobs of email
if you're waiting on a response - and approximately people are - i am sorry i was afk for a week i will respond soon
ughhhh
will read gotta go afk for a bit - still bringing stuff in from car after week long road trip
i had to source many gater's timelines the grammar wasn't good enough for it to work well with just one seriously
and i can make that markov bot fight with my markov bot on command - watch
my markov bot was also on buzzfeed - it catches a lot of gaters
they are both pretty entertaining to talk to sometimes
if you follow they follow back - and then randomly rt fav your stuff if they like it it's weird
gater ebooks is very fond of patreons
tell me what you think about ethics
the ethics policy for gamergate doesn't exist
attn all i'm taking down for maintenance tonight for block lists will still function just not markov
putting them both on the same app secret key just diff user creds adding more sources for gater ebooks doing some filesystem cleanup
i want more than private repos in github gdi
i need to just switch to an organization-based github but i don't want to pay because i'm cheap
sticking to github for now i need to stick with orgs where i know i've got internal contacts for abuse related things
need github but ty anyways
yeah the name of the game lately is staying one step ahead of gater's attempts to shut things down abuse the system
github has been great for that love them
sorry need to stick to github
hehe i'm used to copying a status url and pasting a lot love all of the responses i get though ty for the idea
i've been talking to employees and i heard about a lot of the internal politics re gg it's enough to make me stay
they made mistakes in the past i hope they've learned but the way they treated the gg situation has been outstanding
easier with github i don't have time to spend on being an admin
my new mascot
this is why the media needs to

yup
the worst part of buying furniture from ikea is having to bring it from the parking garage into my apartment don't wanna
well this is a pretty disgusting way to spin things gamergate
doin' stuff
it goes both ways this is from a very limited sample size - people are far less likely to harass on fb w real names
but i've only discussed with other members of targeted harassment from this specific group can't speak for other hate groups
the fact that twitter makes it easier to interact with those you're not connected to may have more to do with this
so in short there's just not enough data to tell
your bot certainly fooled me i must admit i was spanked this time
grafana is weird i've never used it before it does not act like it would expect
er like i would expect
no that's
grafana
presented without comment
not my field at a guess you can be just as tied to a pseudonym as your real name - or even more so
hey do you have a good way to consume multiple json dumps into a single corpus i've been just hacking it together
er into a single model i mean from multiple corpuses or whatever
i thought it was looking at tweet ids or dates i'm pulling from multiple user accounts
consume all vs consume-all doesn't mention model name must be first
yeah i made a bunch of changes with the old ver nice to see some of them aren't needed anymore
i had a bunch of commands to help manage ggautoblocker related stuff also started fights between randi gater ebooks
it's a nice update i quite like it
devopsing so hard right now
in web yes clients other than web immediately delete tweets
you should read the developer policy irt deleted tweets it should comfort you
thanks more fun stuff coming soon
i hate configuring retention policies and flush intervals in statsd graphite ughhhh
i have no idea what these mean requestcontext serieslist guessing intervalstring would be m
i haven't really had to go plonking around in graphite before this stuff is practically a foreign language
hmm using grafana and it's giving me errors
been doing things going to have some pretty automated stuff to show you all soon but for now some kinda neat stuff i found
disclaimer none of these things i'm about to tell you are accurate just mostly accurate there are always exceptions
in the past hrs gg hashtag saw tweets hr of which were rts min max majority of non-rt came from bot
tweets which saw the most rts tend to be questionable abusive and almost always aimed at and me
in the past is seeing the most targeted abuse with rt gg hashtaged tweets mentioning her congrats
when we look at all mentions of a username including rts has received in the past h has received
can't wait until i get more data on this but it looks like should probably avoid her mentions at pdt sundays
rofl
probably uses ggautoblocker which she authored which blocks lots of innocents totally not
well find me some tweets where the hashtag is mentioned saying something that isn't questionable or abusive
oh darn you can't shoot
not enough data to know for certain just what i'm seeing today she's getting a pretty steady level since then
could've fooled anyone was this too subtle
hm
we could do something fun with this i could see how many tweets you get from users you've blocked
the goal here is to eventually have up a pretty dashboard where you can go and see up-to-the-minute stats on this stuff
i'm starting to get a grasp for when the notification ugliness is going to happen so it could be an interesting incident notification tool
however it doesn't scale i can use this to track up to a certain number of users if they target a user i'm not looking at won't
it would be possible with a super low retention for graphs i guess and wsp files that are deleted if they aren't updated in n minutes
but that seems gross and not really how this tool should be used can do better w other things this is more for an overview
wsp is sigh but i'm just using docker in aws with a grafana image fuck configuring this crap
i got statsd graphite working on freebsd once but then i switched to connected line graphs and it crashed
i don't wanna devops this i just want it to work so i can do other things i need a devops
no pretty graphs easily generated out of redis tho i'd have to learn r or somesuch
oh dear
no something went awry box ran out of memory it's also a dev box
looking into it ty for the headsup
yeah i've got a cron to kick it it must not be kicking it properly
or it's not responding to kill signals weeeeird because i ran the script manually and it worked
getting into inst is slow it's oomed prob going to have to aws console and kick it
they are already setting up bots to tweet with the hashtag to inflate it i don't really see this making much of a difference
but if they do i'm happy to turn my graphs over to twitter's abuse department i don't think the people i'm watching would risk that
so i guess i need new jeans or a belt or maybe just some if i'm keeping it real
that's about i think
cigarette trousers
they are all pretty much synonyms cigarette pencil skinny etc
eh it happened i didn't set out to lose weight or anything
i just saw that people requested that i update my amazon wish-list hm i usually only use it to track things i plan on buying eventually
or so i can direct parents there around xmas time
just a reminder this is the kind of logic amp reasoning that we've come to expect from gg
weird i have an address on my account not sure if i need to add that to my wishlist or not
i love amazon basics for misc accessories but why does the power brick for this usb hub have to be so big
it's not a battery it's a usb hub
so faded need a hair cut + dye desperately
totes sjw
fellow sockphiles
i think we really need to talk about these too
why would it
unclear tos prevents bots from being able to contact you without you contacting them first iirc
automated programs whatever it's not clearly written
it's what i'm trying to do at least targeting specific groups causes it's tricky have to look more at statistics than words
ie things not as open for interpretation such as numeric or boolean data is following is not following etc
it's really fun watching patterns emerge in all of this regarding various groups i think it'll be useful
rather amused that despite their protests gg is the only group i've looked at where abuse is easily predicted based on followers
previous versions of ebooks example code using twitter ebooks wouldn't reply to ebooks accounts
the latest version doesn't take this into account iirc i just added it to my custom bot blacklist
oh they are they didn't hurt after the first day or two
he's ok if we were stranded both hungry and i had a sandwich i would probably give him half
gag
verified accounts have features that other accounts do not not sure what kind of overhead increasing that would have
however twitter clients and web are supposed to have the same tools exp that's why devpolicy doesn't really encourage rd party clients
the ability to lock a unique phone to your account already exists eng infra is already there expose if a has been added via metadata
add a filter to toggle showing phone-verified accts in clients requires devpolicy update natch
does have some drawbacks but a nd toggle saying 'show me accts older than n days' is easy metadata already exists client policy update
phone idea isn't perfect it's easy enough to grab a phone from gv but it's an extra step - good deterrent for majority of abuse
in short there needs to be a verified that isn't verified requiring govt ids will cause probs unique phone less problematic not perfect
don't worry i'm sure no one will be like what a great idea until a dude takes credit for it
a lot of people don't have cell phones i was one of them for years i only used against the idea of disallowing gv
i was talking to twitter about it a few weeks ago talked about it here a month ago neener
unaware of their issues do they not have cell phones access to gv
i've seen some strong proof that people in the middle east are using online solutions for sms
this isn't de-anonymizing the phone wouldn't necessarily be stored no names would be required
it's very easy to change your gv
it is really not at all surprising to me that wadhwa and jason are both promoting a solution that removes pseudonymity
pseudonyms are good own it anonymous is not the same thing what jason wadhwa are promoting would require id home address pay to use
go figure that silicon valley circle jerk elite don't realize that some people can't afford to not be harassed
whispers hey guys being free from abuse harassment doesn't have to be monetized it should be for everyone i can show you the way
so my yammering sleazeball cupcakes you can go with and i'll go my way i fight for the users
you don't have to have a phone to get sms you have to have internet which is also required for twitter
the number doesn't have to be stored to be ensured unique
think about how passwords work are they stored in plaintext can the provider easily decrypt them nope
oh god that sounds like a horrible idea privacy problems also twitter likely wouldn't be storing the number that would be bad
i'm still entertained that jason's idea is to either pay a fee or make your acct protected i'd love to hear his thoughts on short skirts
i think we shouldn't make assumptions if they are used in this manner which is diff from their original purpose
still extra work to go through most trolls move on and find new victims
last i checked baldwin was verified
only if you want to laugh at how fucking privileged he is what a tool
accepting pull requests for better ideas that don't violate pseudonymity privacy
i own too many apple products to say that
yupppp jason doesn't have a lot of experience on twitter it seems or a very healthy world view
everything wrong with everything in a single screenshot
if you only want people to use it
i'm foss at heart i think the tools should be open for all to use however for monitoring services things that require infra
it makes sense to ask for donations to keep it up and going and to pay for the dev work ideally this is crowd-funded
this is more from a consumer side though from a business side one could see email spam as falling under that category
multiple gmail accts this is all a lot of effort though most trolls just pick a new target
nothing will ever be perfect but this is a good start towards fixing a huge percentage of harassment
yeahhhh they were operating a loss until facebook bought them fbook didn't buy them to make money off the service
it was to get the userbase and we all know how fbook loves to do social experiments with data
twitter allows yr olds yr olds don't generally have bank accts lots of people don't have bank accts work in cash
may not seem that far out of reach to a lot of people in the us but we're also far removed from the class it
of his points are bullshit taken from white cis male standpoint no harassment on fbook pft providing id addy nope
the client web experience being similar are key i don't know if twitter client has the additional controls verified accts have
i wouldn't do that
i read it only because i already knew what it was going to say he's not a creative thinker
he's regurgitating the same ideas that people have had before they were bad then shockingly still bad now
they don't do this right now i mean unless you are becoming verified
i met with them weeks ago who knows what they might do i certainly don't but we're talking
it sets a bad precedent
as a guess anyways
oh god i am so stubborn just realized the only thing it took to push me off the fence in the real name pseudonym debate was jason wadhwa
it is rather funny how all of us are so completely different yet complement each other's skill sets so well
i think during gdc we should have a social justice league meetup at my apt kthx
that exists in web
donating blood tomorrow pretty sure that i bleed twitter json metadata at this point
'as beck stepped up to take his album of the year award' what is this
pretty sure that and i can take credit for beck's comeback
no i bathe in those
noooooooooooo bey i am so sorry you are still a national treasure
it's how i keep my youthful good looks i will live forever
that's the one
get crazy with the cheese whiz
i like how gg took tb's statement at to mean just hide the harassment in another subreddit
according to ralphreject gdc is just a place for rich people to drink do drugs jeez guys i guess i'll bring enough wine to share then
nichegamer got blacklisted by a gaming company they responded by posting an article friday night about being blacklisted oh boy
countdown to more companies following suit after seeing the way that was handled

gaters get so excited when i talk to them on reddit it's pretty funny i'm sure he's going to go tell his friends how i was totally
original content not rt
oh look here's nero and wadhwa colluding to borrow a term from the gg playbook
hot singles are in your area gt go west the hot singles are circling gt go south the hot singles can smell your fear gt go so
well done ggr you took a huge shit on your own hobby amp it's going to be a long time before the smell goes away
fuck you forever gamergate
i am making buckets of coffee and no one can stop me
wat
no no no no no stop stop advocating that people pay for abuse mitigation
this is classist as fuck living a life free of harassment shouldn't come at a premium come on people what is wrong with you
stop
a year from now somebody you'll never meet sits up in a hospital bed inexplicably worried about balanced parenthes
i was mostly with you until you started talking about charging a fee this is a horrible idea
a low userid doesn't give you any special insight from atop a pulpit of privilege abuse-free living shouldn't have a premium
and he is defending it right now ugh
ideas and observations that are completely dismissive of those in a low income bracket
not to mention poverty levels in some other countries where this amount would be insurmountable or what about teenagers
anything that requires a government id is a privacy concern anything that requires money is a bad idea forever
i'm trying to have a conversation why do you think it's a fight
just because i disagree with you doesn't mean i have strong feelings about you i just dislike your solution
why do dudes have to play the you're not serious just wanting to fight card when women call them out on solutions with ill consequences
given that he already used his low twitter userid to brag about his worth i shouldn't be shocked that he wants twitter to be classist
oh he's also got ties to jason lol okay then basically a waste of anyone's time that isn't a white cishet male
he might actually listen or probably not unless your twitter userid is low
sometimes i hope that ca does break off and become it's own island i love it here but damn the system is rigged
ca physically separates from us in a natural disaster ca decides to separate as a governmental entity as well proclaiming independence
the us goes to war with ca but quickly surrenders when google countered by removing all porn from search ever
a peace treaty is brokered google reverts search to include porn and adds a new google api for cats as a service the world rejoices
ca works to define their new government a meritocracy yes of course how perfect a lone voice in the back not actually a thing
minorities said fuck this burnt the building down left ca's primary export became popped collars the end
see i read that as a certificate authority breaking off and being its own island of site authentication i need
guys are so trained to see women as quiet playthings that when we engage with substance it's seen as sudden aggression
similar to how a woman merely knowing her stuff is seen as an intimidating and aggressive instead of just standard competen
ca is still attached to the us sometimes i do weird things on twitter this is one of those times
i'm not your manager
i could totally write an alternate future for ca more than characters at a time that would be a blast
i would rather it didn't can't we just become an island
it's like hunger games but with internet protocols
it's like frozen if snow was evangelism
i should stop drinking coffee now
haha thanks
i hate cardio lifting is a lot more fun and gets your heart rate up if you're doing it right
treadmills are like ooh look me i can walk lifting is like i am stronger than erryone raaaaar
it's like total recall but with only two breasts maybe
that was one of the few grownup movies i saw as a kid those breasts they stuck with me forever never forget
as do i gt gt i had quit but then gamergate happened e-cig just wasn't cutting it anymore
i can go to sleep after taking adderall my ability to sleep is ridonkulous
fwiw i never quite disagreed completely i'm pretty good at fence sitting
omg i didn't realize
i just found these
better than wadhwa
too many rules females are bad at math
next time i get told that women aren't good at computers i'll just try lavender
what if my skin is so white it glows and i've got blue hair
i only carry of these things of which is pantyhose none

i have several strands of pearls that i love
my skin green no colors suit only wear ripped pants because hulk need no clothes
it's tough deciding how much of my personal story to relate when giving a short keynote about the present state of anti-harassment efforts
i've seen support from places i didn't expect when i originally posted my story still here and i think that's important to point out
we mostly hear about harassment in the context of gamergate but that's a very narrow focus and not the real problem
i find more impactful talks are based around a story but it's a tough balance
woman dev audience i think the real msg i want to get across is that anyone can make a difference even with just a line perl
it's really hard to talk about abuse amp leave it with a positive message call to action is important to not discourage women from industry
which is what gg doesn't get either not even about them it's about harassment they jst insist it's not real b
i've only got minutes so gotta keep it simple i'll figure something out
yo security folks any thoughts on self-encrypting drives specifically wd passport ultra
youre welcome exe
any good solutions in windows pref built-in open source free in that order
those are waaaaay more spendy this is the drive i have just considering using built-in or if i should go software
is bitlocker any good i've never used it didn't realize i could gpg an entire drive either
i just wrote this this weekend it might help some support whole disk or at least
things i hate installers that require a restart and then trigger the restart when i hit finish no i do not want to restart right now tyvm
banished is way too addictive where did my night go
if i had money i'd hire this person and make video games with their concepts omg
here's a thought that would be fairly easy to implement webapp that lets you get stats links to mentions you received from blocked users

how to be completely useless and be a butthead all in one tweet
cool beans useful info after a public callout
i did that after he dismissed me amp my concerns as argumentative might wanna check the time stamps
that's cool next time when a woman talks to him about how his approach is classist he might want to not completely dismiss her
i didn't come at this looking to attack him he's the one that told me to piss off
not publicly and only to him that's not an insult he's the one that referenced it near the top of his blog post
i get that you're probably going to defend your friend regardless but what he did was shitty and then you followed it w more shit
calling me out in that manner was poo-flinging without any reference of why it was totally useless and provoking good job
i'm not responsible for his hurt feelings when he's the one that decided to ignore me instead of having a conversation
his behavior - and yours for that matter - are pretty typical sorry if the truth hurts
also from a fellow sj to another butthurt is generally frowned upon as a descriptor
fwiw wasn't meant as a dig i didn't know this until a few months ago when it was pointed out to me
lord save me from the hurt feelings of men in tech whose ideas have been challenged
that's why i explained i still think you're an asshole
haha i like it
you should have i still would have been irritated and disagreed with you but the response would have been a lot different
yeah see i'm pretty much done interacting with him that shit he pulled is unacceptable same shit i see from sexist engineers
i don't know him i don't know if he acts that way with everyone i only can base my opinion off that single exp amp his
but i can tell you that how he responded - the language everything - was typical of dudes i see being dismissive of women eng
you may claim otherwise but i really don't think he and i are on the same side at all
guys i am wearing a super hero outfit with a cape
literally a cape
we need to talk about this being official sjw uniform
yessssss
fuck this is so awesome i can't stop typing in all caps
no u
countdown until gamergate screencaps and starts talking about how fat i am
blackmilk
who knows they can't seem to decide if i'm a meth addict having tons of babies selling babies or a dude
i do have a fan i will turn it on right now
d'awww i feel like wonder woman
i'm married with kids also
fuck yes
mostly entertained at how they think it's going to bother me posted myself in a swimsuit on twitter obviously give fucks
pretty sure there is
awwww
yes
it's a bug
it's kinda cold but i don't want to stop wearing my superhero outfit
qq gg qq you can take your body shaming with you on your way out the door
it is a really bad thing that now i know blackmilk swims fit well and are super comfy really really bad
i have a bunch of bm already but not swims gt gt
can't too busy being a superhero running around with a cape on
hah i'm overweight as hell still feeling awesome in it it's about how it makes you feel not what others think
plz get urself a blackmilk superhero swim
btw i've got a lot of museum bm that would fit you retro tetris leggings you can borrow if you are into that kinda thing
omg the robot leggings would be perfect
just discovered what happens when jeans are too big while wearing over a swim whelp time to make a belt
ugh these fake nerd guys that don't even know who wonder woman is
this lecture is older than most of the people insulting my pearl code
born a redhead didn't turn blonde until i was
only sluts have skin and hair proper ladies are literal skeletons
it's pretty funny seeing people talk about perl again
sigh why are so many people bad at understanding what dos is
this comment on this article reminded me of you do you stilget dos mansplainers http
oi i was going to ask if you still got these doofuses but the question answered itself
also tfa is an example of an unintentional dos so thanks for playing better luck next time
that has got to be one of the weirdest insults i've ever seen slung by an mra gater whatever
i would rather have teeth pulled
do you know this person i don't generally promote fundraisers for legal fees for people i don't know haven't talked to
why would you do that these lectures are about freebsd
uh
someday a gater will have an epiphany regarding the definitions for dos ddos this unbelievable feat will be a sign of the apocalypse
i don't understand why a simple technical definition is giving them so much of a problem they seem to think dos ddos == excessive packets
dos ddos doesn't refer to a technique or method of transport it's largely defined by intention + end result this is not rocket surgery
if you want you can classify an influx of notifications dogpile as unintentional ddos as it makes core functionality unusable to you
maybe your program forked until it could fork no longer and you didn't have restrictions on maybe you sent an inappropriate amount of udp
will the dev that has never forgotten to put in sleep statements or increment counters or wrote a poorly designed loop please stand up
there's no hard definition of what constitutes dos beyond lack of service service is open to mean many things
remote servers the programs listening on those servers a local app
did you just try to mansplain perl to me and fail
standup goto
congrats you have graduated from dos school with flying colors gl educating gaters
uh every dev makes mistakes
i broke up with a dude when i was a teenager by forkbombing his server
if the only devs standing up are the ones that haven't made mistakes all devs should be sitting down
no worries i think it was a parse failure
d php d
putting it on my list
photographer lynsey addario on war reporting while female on right now everything ab
um that's basic dos has batch files but they aren't basic
wouldn't that depend on lang
not sure i think this could be too easily argued irt if attacks can be unintentional
ex if someone involuntarily starts flailing and smacks another person in the face person is attacked by arm
out of pravana blue guess i'm stuck with mixing some clear with special fx turquoise to layer over existing hair hmm this might be good
existing dye derp
gross netware
well actually i'm kiiiiiiiinda a rainbow haired expert
in all seriousness i've been dying my hair since my teens i can't remember the last time i used a single shade too flat
works well for some colors the pastels are gorgeous but fade super quickly the blues are amazing
depends on shade when doing blues most mp fades out greyish blue most sfx fades out w green tint
i usually mix brands depending on how they fade sfx has fantastic pinks though n'rage does some decent pinks too
gross i'd look weird with no hair
pravana blue - not pastels - mixed with a touch of purple to make the fade gorgeous + pravana clear i swear by it
it's relatively new most salons have switched to using it here instead of specialfx
brb am starting to feel feelings in my scalp that means it's time to wash this stuff out
not sure i kind of like when it fades on short hair if it's dyed well it's less monotone
check it -
pravana vivids are my favorite line for blues easily pastels line is gorgeous but fades so quick days to weeks
pravana pastel pink fade after days the rest was originally mint colored completely gone
n'rage pink after week turquoise is a mix of special fx nrage pink holds very well
i tend to document my hair color experiments for later gt gt that pigtails pic is a few years old
what's the difference between drunk perl and sober perl drunk perl has comments
i'm not as young as you think i am
funny dev joke y n my sense of humor is weird
i'm working on a new project video about harassment amp i need your help need vid clips of ppl reading an abusive tweet they've received
just the content of the tweet not the name of the person that sent it pref with a screenshot
goal is to show people irl reading the words they've received on the internet this has impact
yes and if you can rt and request others targeted do the same that would be rad hoping for + examples
yes i will be censoring the names
email vid to randi io share on dropbox amy file share service whatever you prefer
indeed but i've been coding since was still around for some of that fun used to work on really old unixes too
just general abuse not necessarily gamergate specific
being blocked isn't harassment
thanks
ty
my perl is pretty readable not as efficient necessarily but definitely possible for anyone to read amp understand
this weekend would be cool
thursday would be even better
asking people to read some of the shit they've received and provide a video of themselves doing so is no small thing
has more emotional impact when it's the face of a person reading it out loud
thought you might find this amusing
it's pretty funny that gamergate thinks i'm profiting from harassment i took a huge pay cut by going full time with this
what's funny is that i was drunk when i wrote it - and i wrote it for myself not as something i planned on sharing
i'm not actually a dev i'm devops i like doing things that i find interesting this is interesting
not sure i didn't see it
i just got mad at my hair so i cut it
will do tomorrow
best part about my style amp not having a precision cut is that i can scream fuck you hair while randomly jabbing hacking w box cutters
fashion by randi
what would joan jett do she would cut her own damn bangs
it would i'm hoping for more personal attacks but that's definitely troubling
eep
ughhh someone offered me a discounted all access gdc pass but it's still more than i can afford
go ahead i'd be interested in seeing what you fabricate hopefully they will be more creative than your articles
until now i've never talked to you but i'm sure you won't let a little thing like truth stand in the way of a story
it is weird that someone from gamergate would be opposed to a video not specific to gamergate talking about harassment so weird right
i mean why would gamergate care about a video where people read the abusive tweets they've received what does this have to do with ethics
i keep hearing that gamergate is opposed to harassment i must be misunderstanding something surely
oh wait i take it back i made a mistake i mentioned once before
someone not yet blocked replied to her tweet mentioning me couldn't remember who she was so i checked
yo guys did you know i was a convicted felon that's new
glad to hear from the experts
haha have you seen the tweets they're linking as harassment hilarious
it's pretty funny that georgie claims i harassed her never talked to her until last night ignored the smear article she wrote
pssst - this isn't ethical journalism it never happened ed isn't a reliable source
spreading rumors started by gnaa as fact when you call yourself a journalist is why i can't take you seriously
that was fun now it's over this is why i can't even consider sites like techraptr as anything more than hit piece blogs
she's claiming i threatened to sue her it's hilarious even with an obvious case of libel who has the time
remember when gg posted to baph since when does anyone at baph say awful human to try to get me doxxed raided
pepperidge farm remembers
oh i probably should have warned about that sorry gt gt i'm desensitized to such things
oops sorry for the belated content warning on that they posted some gore so their targets wouldn't distribute the urls guess that failed
totally my bad here brain bleach
headed over to in a few hours to keynote about the state of online harassment
spoilers the trolls aren't hiding under the bridge anymore they are burning it down time to fight back
i was being sarcastic
more spoilers too bad literally turquoise doesn't quite have the same ring to it
no u
i'm epic at color coordination layered tanks of turquoise and pink pink shoes pink backpack pink pullover
i'm decent at editing no worries
i also read it as a gay slur
i was somewhere maybe pink pullover pink backpack
pretty day in sf
dev week matches my outfit
not me no hat
er hat
what company again sorry it's a crazy year
sure i think i can stop by for a bit giving a talk but should be out of here by
i'll shoot you a dm when i've got a solid eta
hanging out in the dice lounge at if anyone wants to stop by and say hi
tech conferences crack me up everyone is walking around in black white or navy blue shirts meanwhile i'm all neon pink and cyan
minutes nervous not because of speaking but because of the content tech stuff is easier so many feels
only if i can get a pass somehow
shit is about to get real
gamergate started harassing 's organizer so we spent the q amp a livestreaming the tweets and discussing harassment
i'm not surprised i wish i was gamergate turned a talk about anti-harassment into a live demonstration
awww i felt scattered as heck i need sleep
women feel guilty when they are attacked - scary but true and not just in tech
wow there's some insanely inappropriate harassment of speakers going on live via twitter of
here is the room at http
i'd tweet about it but i was worried you might get harassed i thought you were fantastic
it's been a crazy early afternoon with i commend her for her courage through all of this
randi io
feeling kind of fantastic after standing on a stage to tell amp show people my experiences being harassed as a vocal woman in tech
talked about weev amp full disclosure mailing list post baph doxxing swat threats family amp friends being threatened being target of a mob
it was difficult i questioned if it was a good idea until someone in the crowd came forward for a hug amp started then i was crying
then q amp a for both of us keynote speakers got hijacked to show harassment happening live both of us talked about diff aspects of harassment
talked about the need for support mentors people that understand because they've been through it all too
i was blown away i couldn't even think of a more impactful way of getting across the point that this is a problem we need to talk
almost crying but not quite i have something in my eye okay
will make a blog post out of the contents of talk + slides which are limited i prefer not using slides
in a meeting
yup
curious as to what gamergate finds more offensive that i'm overweight or that i'm completely unapologetic amp unashamed of it
k
np will be home soon
it's on my list haven't had time yet
sigh
not sure
oh how strange nero glorious leader of a campaign that is supposedly not about harassment is mocking harassment
will take a look
sorry about that gt gt
dude just yelled at me loud enough to hear over my music + noise canceling headphones hey girl you walk like swaaagger fuck yeah i do
not sure if i should be irritated by street calling or impressed my walk conveys my state of being
hoooooolllllleeeeyyyyyy sssshhhhhiiiitttttttttt
here's the word cloud for
i have no idea what just happened
timeline divided between guys snarking about ep and others mostly women thanking us for taking on misogyny in gaming
here's another woman thanking you i haven't seen the ep yet but i've heard good things thank you
the part of the law and order episode that seems implausible is how there's an online threat to a woman and the police do
pretty entertaining that they think nys isn't a hashtag used to justify harassment good job
seeing getting mobbed he'll likely miss this if anyone is in contact w him tell him abt
i didn't read much content just enough to see that he's getting a lot of notifications i ignore fygm girls
just saw this fly by on my stats display a few times tweetstats hashtag gamergate mention freebsdgirl oc lol nope
original content vs retweet
yes
gamergate is trying to do damage control hard i don't think they realize that there's nothing left for them to salvage
amid the anger about this episode the opinions that matter most i think are those of the people raina's character was
yup
not my place if bri zoe anita feel that way then that's their statement to make not mine
tweetstats hashtag notyourshield mention roguestar rt quickly create a shield from the person that posted women's addresses on twitter
let me make this perfectly fucking clear every female major target of gamergate is seeing a fuckton more mentions tonight
i'm watching it happen i'm watching the numbers climb this is bonkers
while some of those tweets are positive the ratio of mentions with gg nys in them is much higher than usual
while i can appreciate this episode just kicked off a new wave of harassment from gamergate time to ride it out
nerd followers i'm monitoring hashtag mentions and sending a statsd incr call for each one
i've got debug output scrolling as i run the program from within screen i always have this up it is scrolling too fast for me to read
it's a statsd call sweetie a protocol not a programming language if you're going to troll get on my level
i'm using multiple streams with multiple credentials
i've got reason to believe that i'm not anywhere near hitting that cap my numbers can be verified from other sources
literally who literally
i'm drunk dude
i can't process all of this right now i'm just watching it scrollllllllll
i am because i've verified my numbers when i was monitoring more than this
i took a bunch of screencaps of the harassment the conf i was speaking at received from them that's going to be fun
oh those were for reasons not necessarily with tonight in mind
it's cool i hope you feel better i know how those nights can happen anything i can do to help
it's hard to not have those feelings sometimes maybe step back break for the night or do what i do use it as motivation
i love your dog so much
you are helpful valuable and appreciated your voice helps we all appreciate you you should know this
nothing ever happens overnight it's subtle stages unnoticed by many i know things are changing i am watching it happen
take a break if you need it but i'm not just saying this to make you feel better your voice is important you matter
since gators are yelling at me for responding to a fan and making this if you wanna fund me off patreon heres a link
at least my irl partner is like x cuter than the guy my weird svu feminist chimera's counterpart is seeing
dude if this is all because zoenitanna dated a shitty dude this svu episode will be so on point i might break my sobri
i don't know what i expected but it wasnt law and order telling me to give up
right on time new wave of horseshit messages being sent to me by ggers shits just flinging from all sides tonight in
nothing has changed not a single fucking thing other than watching a similacrum of me be gang raped on national tv a
at least amazon had the decency to unpublish rape fanfic about real people christ
sorry i don't converse with people that talk to me while hashtagging hate groups kindly go fuck yourself
keynote mentions kathy sierra there is beauty in open web spaces but also
wtf man gets upset that women in tech are upset that said man silences women so you take it down ht
because this is getting to be some inception-level bullshit
i like pink a lot too but it fades too quickly
that isn't me
since of nys tweets have been rts this is normal however previously only inc rt now
nys tweets have tripled since
looking at gg hashtag they were averaging abt before now
notyourshield
at some point there's still a few bugs i need to work out with proper attribution of rts to people that issued them minor stuff
most tellingly of all hashtag + target mentions are up has received mentions in the past hours w gamergate ht
important to note in all of these stats my 'before' is taken from a large timespan 'after' has been the past h typically a slow time
even my own gg ht mentions are way up i'm guessing because of the keynote yesterday
typically mine are fairly low they dropped especially when they realized i wasn't bothering to engage many blocked users
harassing and doxxing prevent free speech they are an attempt to silence their targets
however despite what they want everyone to believe speaking out about your experiences isn't harassing gg
oh they do but they use nicknames or my real names not mentions

i am now watching wadhwa be very disappointed in the eff jesus is that his standard line for every male that doesn't agree with him

so if you thought that this whole wadwha silencing women thing was theoretical here is our proof
well given that vivek got an article pulled it likely has something to do with them being in support of free speech
but for someone who touts eff on their twitter account you are being rather judgmental--are you not

watching completely dismiss women that don't agree with him be very disappointed in men that don't agree with him
here is supporting bcz jason's feelings were hurt when he was told to shut up amp listen about wit
i'm not really sure yet if i feel comfortable with this idea but watching these assholes band together is reminiscent of mra behavior
it was a podcast given by a woman in tech about how she doesn't want him to speak for her
doesn't really surprise me ughh yet another thing i won't be attending driving more industry women away good job
at least he doesn't directly say i speak for women there so that's something
configuration setting mentioning on its own is against dev policy iirc rting isn't
you're
sure yeah i had to bail out pretty quickly - had other meetings planned in the city that day
via
i just watched it was distressing corny early in the ep but then jesus
hahaha yams
honestly it's just not ok from an activist perspective to have a man try to tell women what's wrong with tech's
it was upsetting to see acted out what i'm willing to bet is the fantasy of many gamergaters putting a loud feminist in her place
on the other hand i think it had value maybe i can only hope that law enforcement watches that show sigh
this is my first time ever watching it
you have no idea what crazy internet mob looks like until you've seen what and
step post to facebook step kia links to it step get dog-piled by gamergate w accusations of animal abuse
it did feel like there wasn't much point to it other than ratings a quick win based on current controversy
i want to believe it'll help irt law enforcement education but not sure if it was worth it
in regards to being harassed by gamergate i was just told let your experience better you as a woman instead of seeking sympathy
on that supernova facebook thread hoooooooly shit
sorry to disappoint but i think i'm already a pretty awesome women a low self-esteem continues to not be an issue
y'know what i need a night off running way to make popcorn and catch up on
glad it helped
might be time to make a facebook version of
probably not i can't really afford to go to conferences that i'm not speaking at
how many angles does my fist need i don't understand
so that's not creepy or threatening at all look at all the gaters that retweeted it
don't try to explain the internet to women via
yes that's what i want in a valentine morbid self-destructive obsession with my demise
so supernova is continuing to not respond to my facebook post but the gaters are piling on interesting is the con run by gg supporter
someone said they were not going to attend supernova but instead donate the money for their ticket towards an anti-bullying org do this
vomit
i disagree with but makes me wonder if he's not an easy target for being an immigrant lesson
feminists don't need to be female do not instead let's encourage more men to speak up
you've got to be fucking kidding me
speaking up isn't the same thing as speaking for and i'm sorry you don't know the difference
why are women so mad at wadhwa maybe instead of calling them crazy and dramatic you ask them http

sorry about all the rts but this is a really serious issue this guy is basically the tech anti-feminist that thinks he's an ally
haha how true
i would but my time is super limited these next few days i'm about to have to run too many meetings
for half a second i thought you had come back to wow breaking my heart
i think did that in her first blog post about him doing it programmatically is really hard
it's beyond what i am capable of doing
wrote an article about via
saddest leo ever one of his treats rolled beneath the table and he fell asleep staring at it
congrats
yup
also the awesome counted the of women he follows amp wrote about it here
sure email me randi io
leaning in isn't a bad solution it's just not the only solution it's expecting women to solve all the problems
i'm quite a fan of leaning in it's how i operate but the cost is high and it's not for everyone feminism is about choices
proof that anyone can find love in the nexus learn more gt
i do that come at me bruh
nooooooo
i planned on getting stuff done today but ended up sleeping the day away fu ovaries efffff youuuuuu
someone sent me a pgp encrypted message and they don't have keybase sigh i am in windows this stuff isn't set up
done
poudriere is pretty slick even if i have no idea how to pronounce it
i'm only currently using freebsd on aws no zfs - not much need for it
offline for the night need a break i'll be back tomorrow
having a hard time right now it's probably hormones but this is the closest i've come to making my acct protected kind words appreciated
if one more person dms me i'm going to throw my phone out the window please don't do that
i'm not mad at you i just needed the dm noises to stop
thanks everyone sometimes stuff gets to me when it shouldn't small things i should be stronger enjoying the cute animal pictures
i am now going to watch beyonce videos while wearing the same socks as beyonce
that is awesome to hear
i just noticed that bey is wearing a wonder woman tshirt in her video blow
wowwwww this whole thread
it read to me like you like him bcz he supports yr book
when ur writing a book about wit it is prob not a good idea to do this
a reminder - rts are not endorsements
well let me tell you how this looks throwing another woman under the bus to suck up to a shitty dude while also
a million times this
i agree with this statement
uh and anyone that disagrees is crazy or attention seeking
excuse me if i don't roll out the welcome mat for him
i would rather deal with an mra than wadhwa
he's a weasel you fell for it you're throwing me under the bus
well you have his support but you just lost mine
still a sellout still unacceptable and disgusting
i saw it was deleted
roses are red my hair is blue don't follow jerks or else i'll block you happy valentine's day from
sometimes the bot comes up with combinations of words that are undesirable
it's difficult deciding to call out something as being problematic because that gives it attention amp not many people know about it
there's a woman writing a women in tech book and she's stomping on everyone in her path as long as she gets money for it
she's buddying up with wadhwa because he endorsed her book she's friends with weev who targeted so many women in tech
she wants the attention she's admitted she's a sellout but a lot of good women are helping her write this book
yes
roses are red coldlights are blue murlocs are bad poets mrrglgrgl happy valentine's day
bad they don't know
dehydrated vaginas - i mean pears - for breakfast
i care that she wrote a medium piece throwing all of us under the bus
she's friends with weev an actual neo-nazi that has harassed and driven women like kathy sierra out of the industry
she's trying to play it as we can have our own opinions but i still respect you - no she doesn't she admitted that she was selling out
she also claimed that women being angry with wadhwa was worse than the death threats we were getting because we're used to it
so i implore you to not support any of her projects if you've already contributed towards her book pull out this is horrible
yes
same one
awww vivek made a new friend
remember this is the guy that decided was more important than the women writing her book tarah only cares about tarah
unicorns
yeah
indeed let's chill with that kind of talk please wishing illness on anyone isn't cool
d'aww try sockdreams not sure if they do international shipping
yup and i'm calling it out harassment from either side is bad
sommers
it's always been my stance
not just gaming but being decent humans
there is corruption for sure but it's all in aaa gaming and their abuse of journalists
i guess everybody else decided to go to the dog park too leo is unimpressed
i get the sense from his timeline that vivek is hoping gamergate goes after amelia like they do
wtf is going on
so there
just be careful who you align yourself with she sounds an awful lot like based mom
i think it's going to get worse
she's setting herself up to go against some of the most prominent feminist voices in silicon valley won't end well for book
i am so sorry that you're in this situation
still better that nero's poetry cc
i make about the same as minimum wage
but if you honestly think stuff like is okay then the door is that way - gt
please nominate for a shorty award in non-human
what the shit

i think i'm just going to play video games all day it's been a super stressful week i need a break
which she totally would have gotten had she not continued to rant about me publicly after i said i didn't know
instead she got a block because i'm used to having people shitting all over my mentions and that's a shame
she assumed i was lying when i said i didn't know and that's ridiculous i've been busy the past week
i don't participate in call-out culture i think it's vile i'm sorry bad things happened to her but this isn't ok
now i have a bunch of people coming into my mentions from her yayyyy

i only knew it was snowing because someone on twitter told me amp reporter hanging out w me past few days was flying home into it
but i have only watched morning news twice the past week so who knows what i could have missed
i'm a little jealous i love the snow

of the posts i've read on facebook today are people looking for work jeez i thought the unemployment rate was supposed to be better

i remember having to be at the bus stop at lived far away and i was exhausted all the time
lolllll local news just used the phrase cyber hackers thank you for the clarification i assumed you meant lumberjacks

stop saying cyber hackers omg
curious - so for the rest of the non bay area country - is it normal to see a tweet make news
curious as to if the ap style guide has anything about that
i don't read breitbart
not feeling so great so haven't been on twitter much lately will catch up later
yes although my funds are rather limited so trying to find someone that has a spare gt gt
the kindle has been out for years collections have been out for years cloud collections have been out for year still shitty ui
this is what innovation looks like horrible organization proprietary standards like azw that have a substantial lack in metadata fields
amazon has selection decent prices overall good customer experience but their user interface has been a hot mess for forever
my review of kindle voyage a resounding 'meh'
buttons are weird gave up trying to hit them in the right spot and started swiping to page backwards power button is weird
that would be awesome
texture is different from paperwhite more matte i kind of like paperwhite more more concerned about dropping this one get a case
yeah i've got around books
supposedly battery life amp auto-dimming display
my ebooks collection is getting too big have tech + design books on fire splitting azw books amp other books on paperwhite voyager
yeah i've dropped paperwhite tons of times on my hardwood floors no problems voyage i'm more concerned about
yeah i use calibre it's how i sort between kindles
i think the paperwhite would be a better choice voyage has weird delays sometimes with button responsiveness
fire is still least finicky most responsive of all though i've had for a few years it holds up well to abuse
if i was watching streaming video battery life was just ok but reading books it would last quite a while
whispers lok'tar ogar
i agree it would be great if gamergate stopped finding amusement in harassing people
ps linux sucks
pretty content actually
what news
how dare i troll people that go out of their way to try to destroy my life
reply block is soothing
according to google he makes a habit out of being fired
rather entertained that he sees his not getting threats as proof of anything he's a dude dudes don't get as many
no
why is there a marching band outside my apartment
keep in mind it's not just the volume - it's volume+vitriol disproportionate towards women
sleepytime peach tea with lavender infused honey you complete me

well behaved women seldom make history - laurel thatcher ulrich
uh wow
i suspect many don't have a strong understanding of passive vs active voice that's fairly common of most americans
i've met plenty of people educated by private schools who still fail at basic grammar
one of the best things anyone can do to improve their understanding of grammar is spend some time studying latin
npr asked to speak to me about the wadhwa thing they just got off the phone with him amp now they don't need to talk to me
really really curious to see what happens with this
it could be benign but the hilarity of the situation is not lost on me
email but basically yes
thanks
let's cross our fingers given how he talks on twitter i wouldn't be surprised
can't comment on that i have some runway to get my npo off the ground
lol that guy he tried to tell me that all companies should be small indie all tech companies even
all my sexts are orange because they are legendary get it
given the location of the power button i may follow this advice
blondie's one way or another really is a creepy song
this is really the time to buy in west oakland you can buy a whole block there --white dude in fedora really
omg i wanna punch this guy in the face
happy to help
male friend who interviewed at uber asked about gender diversity amp got the answer our recruiters are so hot
several female friends have reached out to tell me this isn't indicative of uber's culture amp everyone is furious about it int
hi i work directly with the police and this is incorrect most pds say nothing of the sort
staaaaahp don't dog pile his mentions just reminding you this info is wrong
the fact is there is no policy there is no training but all the pds i've talked to do not say this amp do not give any
without the appropriate training for police there will continue to be no advice except for the personal beliefs of the officer
given that the current answer from the police is largely turn off the computer this should surprise no one
uh read the rest of my tweets about this before you try lecturing me
not sure why a selfie stick would need this i guess everything is better with bluetooth
this kaiser pharmacy has a sign saying shoplifters will be prosecuted because you know being poor amp sick isn't bad enough wow
rt this might help lt lt ha
when did the facebook ios app start making noises

i need dumbbells w plates pref up to lbs on each suggestions to find these in the bay area cheap
there is a dude here wearing a baby strapped to his chest and his beard is so long it appears the baby is marge simpson and i
yeah i've seen them cheapish on amazon but shipping is spendy and the clips slide
uh why do they not make these for grownups
if only it worked that way dudes if only
uh okay controlled substances are behind the counter all i see is stuff like tylenol it's a small pharmacy
shaving has little to do with hygiene
women who with perfect responses to sexist questions via
okay you don't even know what this pharmacy looks like but you are inserting your opinion
do you realize how dumb you sound there is one wall with anything on it tylenol orajel and pepto bismol
but thanks for the uninformed rant i don't see enough of those every day
siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh
i called you an idiot not a misogynist
people make messed up stuff with enough otc drugs the idea that shoplifters are just poor folk with headac
vivek is very disappointed in npr
your face is a pain
please report this abuse of api and privacy hack
new clicky

i hate numpads
corsair not the rgb
ugh i need to get married again or something so i don't lose health insurance in a month that's an awkward pickup line to use
see facebook
not sure if i can still see a kaiser doctor with that
cobra is like anytime i've seen it anywhere i am only concerned about a prescription that is w o insurance
lolllllll
unless you know if kaiser will take insurance that isn't kaiser my options are exceptionally limited
uh oxford comma is the best comma
my current insurance is kaiser have a doctor there i have to continue to see insurance ends in a month layoffs
that's absurd
the intro for my hardware hacking zine or why i am even writing this zine
oh my gosh this is awesome
good job you finally created keyboard software that does something useful a++ would install again

dear mary anne and mallory we can relate
this is not just about serving you ads explains why this makes lenovo users ridiculously vulnerable http
i would just like to raise an eyebrow at all the people that were like whaaaat when i talked about how much i hated lenovo laptops before
i've had a macbook survive a + mph motorcycle accident while strapped to my back
aside from security concerns lenovo is shit one time a cage door at a datacentre fell on my head dropped lenovo had to be replaced
i laid the bike down intentionally vs having a worse accident i was bruised but fine
i can't explain this
why am i buying this right now
i'm really enjoying how one of the product images is just a stick of gum also there's cupcake flavored please let there be a cupcake pic
ahaha there is a piece of cake they made out of this duck tape
i can't even
i made the mistake of searching for pocky on amazon now looking at wasabi and apple flavored kit kats what time to move to japan
amazon sells them
omg i need some plz
i am jealous
rmaed my monoprice shoddy power bricks on those getting a refund and picking up another asus it's cheaper anyways
sometimes my mom says such stupid shit that i have to remind myself that i protected her from knowing about much of the horrible stuff
doesn't make it any less hurtful doesn't make me love her any less but she doesn't need to know about all of it she couldn't handle it
it kinda sucks
i had a monoprice mechanical keyboard that was pretty nice but lighting failed nice monitor - until it failed too
oh look who is ban evading well i guess i'll take care of that and i've got paychecks thanks for the concern
roguestar is one of those ppl that i wouldn't be surprised to see on the news for shooting up a store but no one would call him
dude is kind of scary and overly focused isn't he the one that threatened to doxx us if we didn't pay him a certain amount every month
whelp i reported his account for ban evading if it doesn't go through i'll see about manually escalating
cannot stop watching this i blame
it's slightly under k active members
dc is terrible marvel forever
even cracked understands ddos better than gamergate via
yessssssss
yesssssssss you get me
people like you are what give feminists a bad name is wrong but the best defense is not alwa
i think the real question is why do you sign your tweets with kt you realize that your name is right there yeah
both are still marvel
if you think this is people jumping on you then you have absolutely no call to criticize me about anything ever
plz go set yourself on fire egg
this person thinks that people tweeting at them for being a sealioning ass is the worst thing in the world
i've been dreading the day that old people find twitter and start using it to send their angry letters
twitter is basically the angry letters of our generation
hahahahaha
protip when you jump into the mob to harass someone and they publicly call you out as an individual in that mob it's not the same thing
why can't i dm you
don't feed the trolls rogue enough time to rejoice will be had when they rage
this is the funniest joke
if you're looking for a monitor arm this one is pretty inexpensive and works well
if i change the tilt of my asus all that much i have to tighten the bolt of the arm but it's easy to get to
now it worked weeeeird i tried times
yeah i needed something that mounted directly to my desk i get bored and move furniture sometimes
that's the same one i linked
the committee is discussing papers fast amp furious i'm guessing we'll be late so much good stuff this year
has three proposals from women all are good two of them kick hard-core kernel buttock
huh the monitor arm gave you problems
holy crap i've got of them so far just ordered a third i've been pretty happy so far
how big heavy i've got a asus asus nd asus is on the way
it is great to hear that there's more women getting involved with the community is fantastic and has always been supportive
not bad sad that i just ordered my new asus yesterday
i was only able to afford it because i had to rma another monitor sadly tech toys are now out of my budget
i have faith in the project but more awareness needs to be spread about the difficulties and harassment that many female foss devs face
it's going to be an npo so i'll never get rich off of it the goal is just to make enough to live comfortably
oh hahaha i suspect it's because i type really fast new keyboard and all
i've also got my phone docked next to my computer it throws up a notification for dms i use the web interface on my pc to
jira continues to be a good choice if you're using other atlassian products everything is shit it's less shit
i've mentioned before about how i bleed twitter json i could probably construct an api call's return value by hand at this point
i was able to do so without a problem but i have pretty strong arms monitor is a lot lighter than the dumbbells i
in their defense some incarnations of jubilee weren't portrayed as asian
this even caused some controversy iirc
kind of love that the command go potty makes leo poop on command
you get recruiters contacting you actually telling you they want to improve their diversity and they want you to help
and you don't respond because you don't want to be the token hire you don't want to be hired for your gender or race
it implies that i didn't deserve my job that i'm just there for show it attacks the person not the problem
yo windows people is there any free app other than puppet that will allow me to define apps to install on new pcs
who is toby
hopefully i didn't spam you too badly with rts oddly enough a gger pointed your tweets out to me all very well said
haha i just got to refer to someone in my social circles as being the token dude for a lady-centric bottomless mimosas meetup
that's a first
not really i don't like freebsd as a desktop
that's one really big patch
oh boy posted a followup
hee hee heeeeeee
i am listening to this right now and it is glorious
lolol the first thing he says
oh my god
on twitter you don't know who you are talking to - oh this woman couldn't be a software dev oh lordy
thanks to you now people are attacking me on twitter - uh well actually we hated what you were doing before npr aired this episode
these are women not on social media these are women not like the ones you are interviewing - because women on social media aren't real
all of these quotes are from on
sorry i'm not humble dick
listen to the latest episode it's all explained
kelly i'm really disappointed in you - can disappointed wadhwa be a meme
i don't need this money frankly - wait what money wadhwa said all the proceeds were going to women amp he didn't take money for speaking
i encourage your bosses to listen to what you just said - oh let's appeal to the male authority right
meredith - mr wadhwa i would love to broadcast this entire interview the way it is dead silence from wadhwa
ally in social media is a slang word my slang is not good oh here come allegations of racism countdown
about halfway through
women don't understand how journalism works that i have given women a platform
i understand that some women are angry at me but they don't understand how journalism works uh hi i'm in newsweek too
and i used to be a tech evangelist i have some idea of how the press works but thanks for the clear examples of mansplaining
keeps claiming he's not profiting look dude we both know how the speaker circuit works it's about rep you profit indirectly
is so convinced that we're all just misinformed the same guy that didn't even read a twitter bio of a female dev criticizing him
btw pretty sure i'm dealing with more press than you lately so if you want any tips on how journalism works i'm happy to help
dealing with journalists don't use slang if you don't fully understand the implications
dealing with journalists interviews are back and forth not a monologue even if the interviewer is a woman
dealing with journalists assume everything is recorded amp you might be quoted in full to prevent further bogus allegations
but have you verified that she's a software engineer he asks at like that's so unlikely
so now he's claiming that the podcast was edited uh dude probs for time you can't fix this trainwreck
so um how did you keep from laughing or hanging up i'm in awe
what i took from all of this is that doesn't bother researching anyone - just assumes if they disagree w him they are misinformed
this issue isn't about me any more it is about ethics in journalism how a public radio station slanders and then
ethics in journalism ethics in jourrrrrrrnalism no wonder he's friends with that walking burrito fart milo
i was pretty proud of that
didn't he say this was a big problem women in silicon valley had in that newsweek article being too humble
you are literally doing what he says more women should do
oh my god what if he's trying to teach women to be assertive by getting them to tell him to go to hell
i just can't get over how wadhwa wouldn't believe that woman was a dev because on twitter you can be anybody
a lot of women in tech have had to commit themselves so utterly to their work in order to be taken seriously he's denying their identity
for many of us our job is part of who we are because we've had to fight so hard to get where we are
but wadhwa just writes off women on social media as being uninformed or not even real because we don't agree with him
in which only calls out the women who criticize him and not the men
yesterday wadhwa showed us all how deeply sexist he is it's there for anyone to hear in his own words hopefully the word spreads
my tweets last night
can we just take a moment and reflect on everything that is wrong with this paragraph by wadhwa
people say i'm a public figure but ewwww twitter hasn't verified me yet so all these nasty plebs think they are on equal ground to me
it's like faking being humble but then in the next breath being upset that people can disagree with you must just be personal agendas
oh there goes using his position to shame publicly again over her sex life set yourself on fire you sexist scumbag thx
can't believe he did that again jesus hey dudes don't do that not ever ask yourself would i do this to a guy no then fucking stop
being shamed for past relationships is one of the many bullshit things dudes do to silence women especially women in tech
because if we like computers we sure as hell better not have ever dated or fucked anyone ever
hey guys remember when weev released illegally obtained info about my sex life on the full disclosure mailing list bcz i was too uppity
only the existence of a sexual history
you will never ever find anyone questioning the sexual history of a male developer
i just did
wasn't revenge porn just emails between my boyfriend and me along with medical information
lolllllll
set yourself on fire is my personal shorthand for please go fuck yourself because i was told the nd was a rape threat
kathy sierra and that's not what wadhwa is complaining about
harlan city police department issues a p b for queen elsa
yup
vivek offers a fresh perspective on diversity in the next dean's lecture
no thank you
who wants to take bets on if he starts talking about how disappointed he is in uppity women
wow
well then
maybe i'm reading this document wrong
there's also claims that he's made about having a fever which turned into a heart attack in later tellings of the story o o
this is the same company that su bragged about when wadhwa joined them this lawsuit happened years before su
there's some good info in the talk section on wadhwa's wikipedia page too bad it didn't make it to the main article
curious are you just upset because women are being allowed into your nerd club clearly sexism is solved because you're pissed
and before you protest that you're not mad there's not much other reason you'd be out tweeting at women about feminism
throwback to when vivek offered to show me around su to shut me up
i can't believe my wikipedia page is under attack again don't they have policies against all this
there is no attack all changes today are factual cited adhere to wikipedia's editorial guidelines
lol i know that editor
a gamer and a woman oh lordy
yup incidentally i know the editor she's a woman a gamer and in tech it's all factual info
my review got downvotes because gamergate dogpiled but knows this heck he's friends with nero
presented without comment cc
uh no hosted wordpress i do not want you to manage my dns

i mentioned her twice because she's rad
oooo i'll have to look for that

cleaning up old screenshots folder found - i miss these people those stacks so many stacks
yes and you are adorable
i don't use addons anymore
they have some crazy flavors wasabi red bean
i have no idea what red bean tastes like i'm assuming it tastes like beans i'm not really down with beans
huh i might have to try this at some point
oh maybe you would know hey have you heard of anyone doing magnetic implants in fingertips in bay area
has this and i am now obsessed
apparently it makes it easier to find bart so that's something
i don't use addons anymore
remember when
i suspect the bsdcan list of selected talks will not be available today the program committee is discussing some importa
i want to add talks that takes sponsors that blackmail tape of the ceo time to use it
has always been my favorite conference can't speak highly enough of the community please sponsor
i'm not biased or anything ignore my twitter screen name and open source affiliations
has lots of great proposals this year downside is we're rejecting more than ever
i've submitted a similar talk for and i'll be writing it regardless if anyone on the west coast has a venue for it happy to talk
i'll give it at other venues as well but have a nominal speaker fee to cover my time travel lodging
not sure if it would be a good fit it's about harassment creating foss tools and diversity in open source communities
would have to see what kind of stuff you'd want me to present on most expertise now is anti-harassment tools amp devops
announcement - site maintenance
ignore those tweets site maintenance stuff it was autonotifying turned that garbage right off
i don't use freebsd as a desktop
i think i successfully migrated - can y'all go play around and see if you can find anything that's broken
it should be removed if you refresh i think
i didn't even know random was an option
i've got redirects set up so existing articles posts that linked to the old urls should work just fine
eh it doesn't bother me
they have told me that writing this down is 'intimidation'
they have summoned the 'soc'
i've been told that my screwdriver bits are allowed and the handle is allowed but not together
i've been told that the rules are 'my responsibility' and no one can show them
i'm refusing to deal with this passenger
nope didn't have you blocked but thanks for letting me know that i should
no clue who is but she just set her followers on me yayyy mention spam
too busy playing video games to deal with it blocked a bunch i'll handle it later
nope i had to manually block her
had the mention been it wouldn't have been public but a priv conv but when you don't it's public
people reply and mentions get inundated yay
the end result is the same
when you have that many followers you know precisely what happens
lol why do people think that mentioning a username when you've got them blocked is a tos violation
i keep seeing people saying this and it's not a thing feel free to point out the clause in the tos if i'm wrong though
gearing up my dk just hit with her this evening
if a monk has touch of karma up on someone else and i keep attacking why don't i get the killing blow credit when my teammate dies
clearly doesn't understand the difference between censorship and people just not wanting to talk to her

yeah someone dmed me a screenshot meh let her i have no idea who she even is
blocking people is the twitter version of not making eye contact w the people handing out conspiracy theorist flyers at civic center bart
siiiiigh
siiiigh
now i know where to find the people that stand in fire
facebook
frost for now still learning how to play for bgs seems to work well
oh you have no idea what its like to be set upon by the you really want to see that
oh look threats no i really don't care
lol that chick from last night is still raging about me blocking her i guess
she must not realize that blocking people is sorrrrrta what i'm famous for
she's not on the autoblocker and i don't run blockbot blocking manually for now
i don't mind bickering but with some it feels like kicking puppies i'm anti-puppy kicking
i used to have pet bunnies i named them posix and ansi
oh i'm mostly entertained if it gets to be excessive i'll just code a way around it
yeah but if you live your life by what makes other people happy or unhappy then they've won anyways
sipping coffee pulling down follower list running analytics against each of them to create a troll score
with user tokens it shouldn't take long oh darlings i'm scared of no army i've got an app for that
a number of variables i've only run it against a small subset of accounts it's fairly intensive still in beta
follower vs following ratio acct date profile image entities used hashtags urls users mentioned oc vs rt
users you're following along with their troll score plays a factor users you rt of tweets that are sea lioning
see this thread
no i'm not telling anyone what their score is then it'll just turn into a contest for gamergate to try to 'win'
see thread for more info on how this is quantified
part of the reason i'm not actively using it that much is because the weights of each factor are still being decided
this is basically going to be like antispam but for tweets
eggs and other things which will unfortunately be the only part likely not open sourced
ruby perl doesn't have a good module for streaming api forced me to get better at ruby does good stuff
we're totes not dog piling but just so you know you should be scared of us bunnies - yeahhhh
that's why there are many factors matching or variables is expected
i love perl but i think i'm starting to shift towards ruby gem is nice docs are horrid need to read more about classes
ruby seems like it would have a lot of stuff that you don't have to learn so i can write code in it but far to
omg omg omg i think they just asked if obama made ggautoblocker
i don't know because i had everyone else on that thread blocked but i'm am loling so hard right now
how is this a thing
i need to know the story behind that image
the whole me-being-republican thing must really bug these right wing nutjobs that dislike me so much
is he creating a new account or changing his username
yup although i haven't really been able to vote that way in a while it's getting more difficult to find sane repubs
people seem to have a really warped view of what republican even means lately party lines have majorly shifted
hoping it's momentary and not a trend i've not been able to vote repub in a while
pro death penalty anti some provisions of obamacare fewer govt regulations free market better but
my views are largely tempered by my former tax bracket and although i like the idea of flat tax doesn't work well at pov lvl
it's good to see there are still some pro-choice pro-gay marriage repubs just hard to find
most seem to think god is literally talking to them i'm not fond of those
lol time to look at a new social group and write a blocklist i guess
it's only open because i was asked but no hard feelings good luck
obviously she's intimidated otherwise she would have addressed you first l
snort
just checking
if my day doesn't get completely run off the tracks i've got a bunch of writing to do and blog posts to schedule some quick wins
i have no idea what my rotation is honestly i'm just hitting buttons and topping damage meters in bgs with a fresh
plz stop posting pics of me that i posted a few weeks ago i care so much about what people think of my appearance it's what i
oh darling mras you making jabs at my appearance won't keep me from working to provide tools so others can shut you down
but i guess you're not really sure how to react when a woman has resources to help others fight back such a quandary so perplexing
when the most you've got to throw at me is tweeting insults you don't really have any weapon at all
oh yeah i spam the hell out of those buttons
lol some of these are supposedly women jealousy isn't a good look for them
oh lord she's filing a false report on you for supposed false reporting
yep we all remember what happened last time i was fake-report bombed right minutes to fix it
i had a rescue puppy named
a lot of you are new followers since november so i think this bears a reshare my story
i haven't done much work with this kind of thing so it's all a learning experience
i've posted a contact form at for support regarding speaking requests feedback etc
i'm looking for a few people to help with 's twitter log amp categorize mentions as support requests abusive positive tweets
possibly respond to some support requests with canned answers
woops
have team members sticking with this for now thanks everyone
someone posted this on facebook in response to that woman tweeting at me earlier today
i need to update that
it's true there's a risk but the same risk is involved in just following the twitter account
even with twitter allowing pseudonyms it doesn't really prevent the trolls from tracking them down
this guy thinks i'm randi harper have we met
need skype verification for keybase io
looking at comments marked as abuse on my site that must be the problem i have a hostile womb
wat
that guy kept going for a while too i think he proposed are we married now does this mean i have health insurance
one of us one of us
poor it's not that he wouldn't date sjws it's that my bot is the only sjw that will have a conversation with him
ok look someone is messaging me on something i hear the ding i don't know which account which service which computer uh dm me
if you reallllly want that search for ggautoblocker i ran some ads last night
it is really funny all the assumptions they make about how it works - and how much they are wrong
yesterday a dude that swated someone admitted that gamergate - more specifically someone on the gamergate sourcelist - paid them to do so
now that person has been doxxed on chan and despite this being the person who posted my amp others' home address suddenly he sees a problem
i'm not going to say i told you so however i will say that you'll probably see this and you know my email address if you need
it was incredibly fucking difficult to type that
i really just want to curl up and nap but it seems quite a few people are dealing with doxxing fallout today on both sides
it's been a really long saturday i still haven't slept this is why it's still saturday i'm tired amp i just want to curl up but waiting
i know of at least people that are dealing with police today after being doxxed on chan trying to be available if i'm needed
the guy who paid
please stop with all of the karma negative comments there's a bigger issue here than the person that was targeted
in many states we've got laws that specifically protect against this kind of thing however they aren't enforced due to education funding
feelings about the person involved need to be separated from the real issue which is advocacy education law and tools
the current system is inadequate some of us are experienced at navigating these pitfalls and we can help you
ca has some interesting ways of getting around jurisdiction issues still researching other states
that's actually kind of interesting i'll give them a call later next week i need to talk to them anyways
if your friend needs help knowing how to talk to police prevention etc they should talk to or myself
only when it counts i'm pretty snarky when it's not serious times you know
everyone is awkward most people think they are most awkward than they really are you're fine
aw thanks
if you're in trouble i recommend using i can also help provide assistance
as a reminder assistance requests are private you can be anon but i need to know situation pref w location pgp
email if you don't mind gt gt is i'm randi io
twitter isn't really optimal for long conversations
shot her an email
aw i was talking to a gater on reddit for the past few weeks he seemed nice enough but he just deleted his account come back
not sure sounds like he left for good
he kept me informed on stuff id missed and seemed ok i liked him
that's not funny
this song a million times loop it foreeever
hi want to get drinks
it was private messages
we can tweet each other in all caps while we are at the pub if that's your thing
i think that this person didn't like some of the behavior too perhaps why they deleted their account
in the right circumstances i'm a lot more tolerant and understanding than many would believe
wary isn't the same thing as condemnation
i'm tired and confused - have been up too long that isn't my ip
ughhh ghazi why
i said it in too likely might want to attribute all the years
ah hah
i'm bothered by the attitude from every poster in that thread in general but i might just be grumpy
i'd love to see how twitter determines gender amp interests when doing targeted ads guessing it's not something like bluekai
nachoshield is getting a bit quieter again
i got one of those cheap usb microscopes and now i'm having way too much fun
is the one i got if you get it don't install their drivers just use default webcam drivers
try
mine is definitely usable i quite like it stand is kind of meh but the device itself works fine
my hair
oh god oh god oh god never point a microscope at skin
so gross feeling the urge to shower in boiling water
or in properly angled photographs at low resolution with the brightness jacked up need this photoshop filter for irl
i just showered in the hottest possible water while and exfoliated like crazy for the past minutes not even joking fu science
several people have pointed out where were you when i needed you for life advice xkcd
i have no idea wtf is going on or why i am mentioned in this tweet
ok name the person who paid the swater if your claim holds up they'll be dealt with
sorry i don't believe in gamergate's version of justice mass reporting isn't dealing with anything
frankly i have more legal and tech resources than a hashtag plese go spew your hate group propaganda elsewhere
weird guessing that she'll be back i don't really understand why people delete their accts vs just closing twitter app
i have no idea what this tweet is in reply to
i'm not linking doxx
mostly joan jett lyrics
that's likely the same person i'm talking about
ah okay
weird
gamergate isn't really sjws it's for people that don't want to get notifications from gamergaters
what he did was wrong and should be prosecuted however he's now been doxxed and targeted as well it's a clusterfuck
oh i see you're another useless gg supporter lol go away
we can't take any action other than offering advice and assistance person targeted has to report it to police
the sweetest love story a freebsdgirl and her coffee maker
it's not pink
please untag me from all of this it's spamming my notifications
that's ah all of my kitchen really i have a thing for english tea roses patterns too
i'm going to cut in here - despite blocking you - to explain something that seems to confuse many people
this is a criminal case not a civil case this means that it's up to the police to decide if it's worth prosecuting
while you can hire a lawyer to help you speak to the police that's kind of where their - and your - involvement ends
if someone has had a crime committed personally against them online the police aren't likely to listen to anyone but them
so please take your accusations of why aren't you prosecuting evil antigg scum and go educate yourself
it doesn't surprise me that gg has turned my offer of help for one of their own into a reason to screech at me but it's still
everyone should be jealous of my coffee maker our love is pure
noted i'll put it on the list of accounts to kick further up the chain
yo you planning on going to blizzcon this year
i can't imagine how hard it is let me know if there's anything you want me to promote any help that i can give
yay i went last year and had to make new friends i hate making new friends i didn't know anyone else going
uh it's also pink which makes the coffee taste better
no one from requiem ever goes they are too antisocial
sweet no one has used this yet and there appears to be somewhat of a delay watching to see when it goes through
if it's something that needs immediate attention randi io works as well
hashtag nachoshield hashtag goobergrape
thank you
you're searching her name and contacting people that talk to her that's a bit creepy stalkerish
as to if i'm working with her that's of your business this isn't an adequate use of your time shoo none
i don't comment on who i might be helping and i'm not here to pass judgement on anyone's activities
telling me don't help this person they are not really victims probs isn't going to get you the reaction for which you are looking
someone else - which means people are actively searching her name which is still creepy
if there is a 'culture war' to be fought it should over whether or not harassment is acceptable not when i
hi i still saw your tweet one i'm female obviously two this isn't helping
sigh i need to work on building out my legal contacts to encompass more states
yo do you know of a reliable breakdown of harassment stalking laws for each state
searching for amp reading each state's penal codes individually is tedious
i'm very entertained that all it takes is iq for me to know precisely who is being discussed
that would be awesome
i'm envious of your education knowing how to interpret some things seems tricky to say the least
i would love that would you mind dming me your email address can shoot you an email later today
well that just made my life much easier
this is mostly what i need interesting to see that some states don't have statues on both
anyone that is getting harassed is welcome to come to me for help it's all anonymous
if not anonymous then at the very least privileged information
general folks in the legal field at this point but issues will mostly center around local harassment stalking laws
amp possibly being able to provide referrals for people that want someone to help them navigate reporting to pd
police tend to take reports of online harassment threats a lot more seriously when a lawyer is involved
these would likely fall under the lines of pro-bono work at least until my npo is up to help fund
i'm not entirely certain how all of this is going to work so i'm still feeling it out
let's talk about what it means to be a victim
shoot me an email randi io
kathy sierra on silicon valley meritocracy and skater culture
i feel weird putting up quick little posts like that like it's lazy and bad but i think it's a conversation that needs to be had
no my blog post
kathy sierra everything she writes is pretty awesome
it was difficult for me as well until i realized that one could be a victim and still fight back
for victims of abuse it's often not discussed because of a feeling of shame victim assumes fault then public assigns blame
haha
things are coming together if all goes well with my next meetings i'll have a major announcement to make during gdc
you're going to be in town yay
success
you're both awesome thank you for your work
a huge thank you to giving wadhwa a platform with which to prove his character was of great help to
he's said that he's backing out but i think this remains to be seen however i'm optimistic
i have no intent on linking to the articles where he stated he was backing out they were an attempt to save face not an apology
oh you haven't heard it it was amazing
oh gosh i hope you feel better
i'm usually optimistic about people and their ability to change but i've heard enough background story from reliable sources
replacement monitor arrived i now have vertical - - this may be too much desktop i have to turn my head
it is java's installer still prompts to install the ask toolbar ugh oracle do you even go here
the rule of the apple mini-displayport to dvi adapter is that you will never be able to find it when you finally need it
the contact form on the site was bugged turns out that if you use a ' ' in the email subject prefix it breaks everything silly wordpress
a day of meetings a day of notifications to catch up on uh will be doing so later hit me up on other medium if it's an
analytics for the last days tweets from amp caused spikes http
nice interface much prettier than the grafana setup that i'm using
ugh what did he do this time
so don't do that
yay my talk got accepted at see the full list of talks here
i'm nervous in a weird way because these people are kind of like my extended family it's not a hard talk to give to strangers
looks neat i need to start keeping my eyes open for cfps
i'm almost in sniffles at the thought of seeing my freebsd extended family again after so many years clearly i need more sleep
more so because they've known me for such a long time talking about polarizing personal experiences is easier with strangers
someday i'm going to drink amp start submitting pull requests to various foss projects' makefiles to play fitting theme music during a build
i like you
one of the hardest things about not working on a team out of an office is never letting myself sleep in coffee save me
woah nah you're amazing and one of my favorite people on twitter
a few people poked me yesterday but i was up to my eyeballs in meetings responding later this morning
as the announcement date draws closer things are starting to pick up to a rather frantic pace
i honestly have no idea how i am managing this it is surprising
omg if goes to there's going to be trouble
talk about bringing tweets back from the dead
forever entertained by the 'clink' noises my lip piercings make against my coffee cup i think i'm still goofy from lack of sleep
how sees trans ppl and sex workers nice u got there lady
having to explain to my doctor that the optional surgery i was planning on can't happen for the next few months bcz no time to recuperate
not no time like i don't feel like committing to this right now but i have to set an alarm on my phone to tell me to sleep
uh okay
pocky ever
you don't know that
aw thanks
i used to talk more shit now everything is weird too much attention i'm representing more than just myself
i miss the days where i could be more of an asshole
i really appreciate the kind words from you i'm a big admirer of your voice
welcome to the latest episode of cto thinks he can still code with your host poor fucker who has to clean it up
things are worse than normal this is the new normal please adjust accordingly
lrt everything ever
i am confused by the idea of inflicting obesity on others is that like force feeding doritos
i am not sure if enabling twitter from within wow is a good idea or not
verification yes this is me
i can't receive tweets in game only send
i love you nayadri
sometimes i feel like olivia pope
ugh no i am finally dealing with imposter syndrome this is not a thing that i'm used to having to manage crap
i'm pretty familiar with the concept but not the feeling good read though
i've given a lot of tech talks in the past this one isn't really so technical more community
it's kind of hilarious that i'm so self-confident that the very second impostor syndrome starts kicking it i realize something is wrong
uhhh we don't catfight over money sorry
this isn't going to work because we've all got a maturity greater than year olds
i mean we're at least
we're all very different people with very different backstories and purposes but we respect each other
they don't even go here
i both of you the scene in captain america with the grenade i'd do that for both of you
who knows who cares just more bullshit they are passing around i don't pay their claims any attention
uh this is what angry looks like with undead it's supposed to be fist in air not slapping my own butt
oh hell is blizzard proxying tweets instead of sending the tweet content directly to twitter from the wow client
i guess that's one way to get around the user token count limitation per app id
i need to think about this i don't think i like this
i think the biggest problem i have with it is that there's too much of a reliance on wow services for an external mechanism
i'm still not certain this is happening but the delay between sending a tweet and seeing it appear is far too long
kiss keep it simple stupid very much applies to designing a new feature if blizzard is proxying tweets that's unnecessary and bad
pickaxe is the new crowbar
it's basically what we already do in game
if you find a good place lemme know
yeahh i'm not going to retweet that that chick is mentally unstable amp loves to post private convs it's not ok
wow by balancing stones an artist finds peace
clearly witchcraft
the claims she has made are not something someone in their right mind would do
she threatened to cut herself if we didn't pay her money
yeah this probably isn't a good public conversation to have i just stay away from her
i have no idea how that even works that video is crazy
want more fun stuff google the name of the person i rted that music
there is currently a vocal male on twitter that claims to be all about anti-harassment he has defended gamergate in the past
at this moment in time i am unaware of any effort he has made into this space i'm tied in w many orgs his name has never once
he's been offered contact info from those he's speaking with should he care to contribute he's utilized of this i am unimpressed none
if you're interested in working on solutions we'd love to have your help however i can spot a flail for media attention from a mile away
what this person has done is not just voiced an opinion i'm not going to get a pile-on going so i'm not giving specifics
since this was questioned i should be clear i'm not talking about supporters or just people with opinions
i'm talking about people that take an active stand to say they want to create solutions for harassment but do nothing beyond get rted
for everyone that is involved in this space there's a huge personal risk people get targeted friends and family get targeted
frankly it's a little irritating to see some guy with a huge following come along and say i'm gonna do stuff and then do nothing
or well something happened a hashtag was started by harassers to support him so that's something i guess
tbh i feel bad anytime anyone actively enters this fight without knowing about the personal cost
i'm not mentioning names for a few different reasons
it depends on how you define meaningful if people listen to you vs there's a huge difference in voice
as someone that went from followers to what i've got now i've seen a huge difference
doesn't drive but is in many cases an accurate reflection
i bought crepes but i don't really know what they are so i am just going to call this a fruit burrito
i am really curious as to why is throwing around accusations of bullying when someone expresses an opinion irt writing direction
this thread - this doesn't add up am i missing something
omg i am dying laughing
i'm a little concerned the tweet still exists i see no retraction published
the use of the word 'bully' in this context is worrisome and relevant to any conversation i have
given the massive glee i'm seeing from gg irt that tweet it's concerning that he's not retracting or explaining 'bully'
if i was looking for pitchforks i'd point out a white dude in a position of power accused a minority of bullying him
thank you for calling me on this though i probably should have made that more clear in the original tweets
please no pile-ons don't tweet at him etc i think the conversation is concerning in that we need to discuss what bully means
looking at your icons judginggggg
haha mine is worse
thank you random internet person for inserting yourself when i said no pile-ons
this is what passes for entertainment around here
talented leo
it might be time for a new profile pic for randi ebooks
you should see his guilty look
yup probably a mix of some sort he's from the shelter
i had a bunch of clip on hair extensions from when i had longer hair decided to let him use them
that's an awesome name
how many toys can be stacked on his head
more dog treats
awwwww
nintendo ds
manga guide to statistics
dreamcast controller
charity auction
no dog treats
the bacon belongs to me
i ran out of things to put on his head sorry
hahaha
it's about ethics in controllers on dogs
i am really curious as to why someone would try to sell their own children for crystal meth
i am really curious as to why there are people stupid enough to believe that encyclopedia dramatica is ethical journalism
your face is awful
your mom was uncalled for
most of my oreilly books are ebooks those are all so old but yes i usually quite like them
i honestly do not understand the attacks on this man - on
i reached out to with concerns the day the article was published no response nina cares more about page views than problems
she had her chance to understand but she's decided to dig in her heels whelp lesson learned eh
lol she was one of the people that gave him a platform and then ignored detractors
according to we should be happy that dudes are talking about feminism even if they are telling us how we are doing it wrong
this is shades of bullshit wadhwa said that women that disagreed with him were just looking for attention these were his words
if this is an ally then fuck everything amp set the world on fire was dumb enough to get sucked into his bullshit vortex
the thing i said to an account that was a confirmed sockpuppet that was supposed to infiltrate sjws lol
go fuck yourself
uh because one group is literally killing people are you nuts
who are you referring to with 'we'
i've also been told that some of the people mentioned in 's article didn't even talk to her she quoted them without asking
which is fine i guess but she went out of her way to talk to wadhwa interesting no
yes given that one group routinely posts mutilated bodies on twitter along with american passports i'd say they are worse
and i couldn't give less fucks about alienating followers by giving them an opinion they don't like
i'm calling her dumb because she fell for his bullshit and also quoted one of the women he abused
twitter search for my name and set yourself on fire and see if i give two shits about what you think
it was up on chan someone probably has an archive somewhere
why is there a double standard with terrorists from being prosecuted quickly while harassers of
you just lost from crowd funding of your cause choose your battles
sorry i'm not going to say gamergate is the same as isis and you can shove your donation up your ass
i don't change my views to get money that's not how this works
he also makes claims of racism if someone calls him on repeatedly using feminist terms incorrectly i don't care
this is what you just said you just compared online harassment to mutilated bodies this is demeaning
online harassment is a serious problem and it needs to be addressed but making false equivalencies won't get you anywhere
let me make this super fucking clear i will not compromise my beliefs in any way just to get donations that isn't happening ever
i appreciate every donation received but ppl that threaten to pull funding if i don't say the things they want to hear can fuck themselves
holy shit seriously i've done research into both groups i've seen the tweets amp patterns gamergate isn't isis
you're not going to get the response you're looking for give up
the threats are either serious or they aren't i guess you don't view as emotional terrorism
yeah
why do you think that you know more about the abuse i personally receive than i do
you made a false equivalency i called it on you and you threatened financial consequences
i mean this from the bottom of my heart go fuck yourself
sweetie you wandered into my mentions threatening me with financial consequences this isn't bullying it's backbone
something is seriously going down see lrt of gg is pushing a weird narrative
yup something is happening not sure what
uh you came to me with financial threats
when you're an asshole in someone's mentions and they react it's not bullying
i don't think you understand what bullying or harassment is at all
but protip you'll never have the freedom to wander around being a jerk without consequence
no i asked if you were nuts
nope you keep saying that but we both know you're lying show me where i called you stupid
where did i call you stupid show me the tweet
show me where i called you stupid
you've now repeatedly told people that i called you stupid though
it's about ethics in journalism
'colleague' - we don't work together collusion
this week incident devops incident journalist incident journalist phd student journalist phd student photographer lordie

the ring made me think of hackers when i bought it
omg it's here
hey i just met you
but here's my number
so call me maybe
newp
i'm always looking for an excuse to sing that song
fuck yes
every time i meet with a journalist that is about to post something that is going to make gamergate angry i suggest using
i'm not even going to lie this makes me giggle a little bit on the inside
trying to decide if i have time to contact police before call w lawyer never thought i'd say this unless i was in trouble tequila involved
sometimes a lot of this still feels like playing at being a responsible grownup discovering much as i travel this path good place to be
to be clear i'm not in trouble and the call with pd has nothing to do w call with lawyer both related to work
yeah i tried to talk to him he won't even tell me why he thinks this is a thing
you're really fond of lying about everything i said they aren't isis
stop trying to cause shit it's not going to work
however i'm going to block you now because what you're doing is abusive and not ok
i don't know but i feel like would
only if you come with us bby
omfg i am logging in wait for meeeee
when is my stupid selfie camera going to drop ffs
yesssss photo b o m b
i love ashran
i will punch you
nope i play wow gw sux
plz zebra katz plz
uh hi i'm going to call you on that line right there what rating do you play at in wow
wow pvp makes me happy i play rateds and i'm pretty good at it you are basically a door to door salesman right now
i don't pve
just enjoying youtube playlist while pvping
players love to make digs at wow being old wow is old but it's also pretty well balanced i pvp competitively
i love it i'm invested in it my friends play it i've played gw it's ok but the pvp just isn't as good
but regardless i posted a screenshot of something i love doing and you made digs about it being out of date so whatever
amp if you want to sulk about being called on it i guess that's your prerogative
thanks bing
how have i never heard of ball culture this sounds amazing
it's rather presumptuous to assume that i'm straight
i'm reading about it now
for those seeing in ends the debate
is obviously gold and white
i have no idea how anyone is seeing blue at all i see no blue
wired is wrong
i am so jelly gt gt
black bar according to weirdos
it looks like it's white with shitty color balance
look i don't care about your photoshops or your computers or your wizardry the earth isn't flat and is white and gold
oh no
you've got to be kidding me
yes i turned on profanity filter because i'm trying to curse less it's not working as you can see
i am grandma
i would never ever want to get into a debate with you over whether or not something is blue
this is the best point i've seen made about ever
not sure if being sarcastic or obtuse
i seriously only see white
all of that means eyes work better crap was obviously made up by those people fake science
that's a hoax
stop lying
there's a white black option
hugs
yup i went in the water
another example of comments that female foss devs get on a regular basis don't like her code insult her appearance
this isn't rare this isn't even gamergate related this happens all the time
more shit that dudes don't have to put up with
if it didn't work you guys would probably be crying about it stealing your freeze peaches a whole lot less
not only that but this rocket surgeon apparently doesn't understand the difference between comments and man pages isn't he precious
this isn't just gamergate this isn't just gamergate this isn't just gamergate this is a more obvious version of what already happens
want more women in foss dropkick these people into the sun
rage eating pocky
rogue literally got fired from the company that made farmville no one wanted to work w him there
he had a huge ego never produced anything and everyone hated him kind of like twitter
let's not forget that the person that started these rumblings about my code got fired from zynga for being impossible to work with
he tried to do an ama on reddit about working at zynga implied all of his coworkers were twats got shouted down by all of them
couldn't find another job in the gaming industry after that because insulting your coworkers former employers is just something you don't do
sure ama is here
relevant comments
he really picked the wrong women to go after me thinks
no worries

my take on twitter's safety update propaganda doesn't give clear info on what these new actions are
until twitter provides us with a way to filter new accounts or provides a higher barrier to entry these are just words that mean little
the developer policy needs an update that allows us to filter non-promoted tweets twitter clients continue to have bugs w large block lists
i'm optimistic this isn't the end game twitter's announcement was a single step in a long path in mitigating abuse problems
laid off along with a whole game team
is a good option but it's a partial solution we need the ability to filter accts w o phone number attached
most abuse comes from gamergate accounts that are days old
i write bots to block it
you had to pick the tweet about spock and not about drinking with star trek
star trek was one of the only tv shows i could watch when i was a kid
i miss you
i didn't have an outward emotional reaction when my own grandmother died but i am crying for nimoy
ipad air or ipad mini
omg i am listening to an apple genius dude tell this old woman how to use email and it is adorable
twitter email evernote web hearthstone
not so subtle hint just spent a while with apple opening up a very specific kind of account
rumor to helm apple car project tech sites i'm available for hire
my favorite command for spot checking lists shuf file txt
things are happening big things i could not be more
todo email tax guy to ask if lavender bath bombs qualify as a business expense
indeed
vibrating with excitement every day brings us closer to being able to make the announcement
meetings left likely sometime next week
what do and have in common nasa's getting in to it too
if there is one thing in life we can count on it's if you ask a question regarding opinions on apple products no one will agree
apple is the horde vs alliance of the tech world
i'm not entirely sure i agree with you there
the full body project by leonard nimoy nsfw
he lived long and prospered leonard nimoy reported dead at
remember leonard nimoy with three of his best star trek episodes
require a code sent to a unique cell phone in order a thing off amazon to open jars for him
just trying to make people i care about gender fluid
oh my rt in a telegram pleads with jfk for a safer planet
uh i am displeased that you want me to reply to these emails with more details when i file a report
if wants more details they should ask for it in the interface when i file the report - not seconds later in an email
it's friday so i was going to order a pizza delivery time minutes uh
hah not from a chain pizza place
i usually go with thin crust garlic pesto sauce feta + garlic toppings is good even with chain restaurants
oh yeah i didn't hear about that
watching people like further fygm culture that's unfortunate
so claims that only people new to the industry claim sexism exists yawn i'm a + year engineer try again
it's easy to think that our experiences are indicative of everyone's experiences i've fallen victim to that thinking before
unfortunately a positive experience doesn't cancel out a negative and playing the cool girl game isn't a good look for anyone
yep + year engineer here can confirm
i have a photo shoot thing tomorrow i guess i need to clean my apartment and dye my hair and get this dumb code done ughh ughhhh
fygm = fuck you got mine
fygm culture is a real issue like i fought my way here and it sucked but i'm strong if you can't do this it's your problem
fygm culture is a complete lack of empathy i fought my way here sure do i think anyone else should have to do that hell no
fygm is keeping the status quo so you can feel some kind of superiority over the women that opted not to put up with the abuse
instead of perpetuating fygm culture why not try to fix things why not try to remove some of the hurdles would that be so bad really
if us women in tech are strong enough to get this far why aren't we strong enough to mentor to push for change no more fygm
i guess it's one type of strength to make it this far another to recognize the problem amp speak out not playing boys club games
it's been my name for many years since before twitter existed
i have bots to block all of that
i'm not sure i've never been down the track of art so i don't have much to say about that
i imagine you as a super heroine who saves people from shark attacks
working on setting up desk for the photo thing tmrw lcds macbook air surface pro ipad air leds on everything hello i am computer
oh sweetie i don't do passive aggressive i'm aggressive aggressive
prove it where is the proof
you guys don't even know the difference between the lolnope
omfg on the local news they are now arguing about
that moment when you silence a mage and they start backpedalling and you just know it's about to go down
bahahaha it's a quote from a glee commercial
okay i'm back
looks like we made a few of them mad
undead ever
stop taking bathroom selfies you fucking peasant
more than a little entertained at all of the gaters that are upset that i fight back instead of just shutting up fighting back is bullying
standard operating procedure for bullies is to paint victims as perpetrators of bullying to authority
people will find a way to interpret anything to match their message unfortunately
aw gamergate harassment squad did i say something to make you mad
oh i see it's sending her little harassment squad after me like we can't see right through her innocent act
there's a reason we started tracking all of her followers an immense amount of racism sexism abuse was coming from her corner
the thing is you don't actually have to say any of that stuff for us to figure out who it's coming from it's easy to track social
so she can try amp claim innocence but statistics paint her as being someone to avoid and i've been in her sights for a while oh well
ignore fools embrace the term bitch it means you have strength and express your own opinions bitch is
i don't usually like pointing out individual names unless they've gone above and beyond in attempts to hurt people
like when said that only industry newbies believed sexism existed or when sends her harassment squad after ppl
how should i even classify this wielding a mob indirect bullying i'm not sure
it's like somebody juggling knives who won't take responsibility if one of them hurts an onlooker
the amount of mean girls mentality coming from gg supporters is hilarious on wednesdays we email kotaku
intel you can't sit with us
if you have ever felt personally victimized by ethics in games journalism raise your hand
i'm thinking about it ideas aren't really fully formed though
i think there's a really fine line beyond being vocal about your experiences and indirect bullying
yeah i need to start looking at finding a oh wait i can't drop that news yet
omg is that what happened i keep hitting the wrong button
ok that's enough poking the bear have a lot to do today my most difficult decision is going to be what to wear gt gt
that makes sense also how horrible is it that block has become muscle memory
that moment when i think that i'm out of coffee then pull oz of ground arabica out of my backpack yes more glory to the coffee
confirmed seeing the same thing in web
my fav part of skimming gg tweets is seeing so many people insist that they are unable to develop their views with experience
ie they will still feel this way in years lollll
they also love to add years to my age which doesn't bother me i grew up envious of unix beards
this is coming from the same group that claimed i faked my linkedin because it was impossible for a yr old to have done all of
this might be my favorite tweet by rogue ever because he assumes my twitter handle is my unix login
and then there's this person who suggests pc-bsd because freebsd are all sjws
pc-bsd is a fork that is mostly funded by ixsystems the organization that runs freebsd marketing it's a frontend on top of freebsd
all that collusion in the bsd community sure is hard to keep track of
in short this is the most hilarious gamergate bsd fail i have ever seen
btw guys i'm an admin of the openbsd facebook group so you know collusion
oh yeah and freebsd is the os that runs on your playstations why so salty
he expects unix logins to map to github usernames - which they rarely will
i would put cash money on them not understanding your profile pic
i can prove that my code is in freebsd and there are articles that state that freebsd is running on the and
yup unless it's your field it's not surprising that you wouldn't know
they searched for my twitter name in freebsd's github
i know nothing about writing code in windows
i have never seen a single indication that roguestar is in any way technically competent
i i just want to go home please mr rouge i have k-
pointed freebsd devs at this thread their response now discussing if they have hipster beards used as an example
presented without comment
perhaps managing to a search the canonical svn repo for b the correct username would help goo
yo are you going to is going to be there we could cause trouble
thank you
ele shaman
hey guys look at this little cutie trying to bully me
getting ready to kill stuff with my teammates
posing for extra style points before wrecking everyone
to be fair most of my activity happened under my own commit bit
but rogue isn't really dev competent he thinks all dev happens under github
watching other bsd devs tell roguestar he's wrong and it is delicious
bsd is a good community wandering into it and attacking one of the few women contributors is going to get some people talking
i have never felt more supported and safe than i do around the freebsd developer community they are amazing and i love them
the smear tactics aren't going to work these people have known me for over a decade
so far the primary response i've heard from the freebsd dev community in regards to all of this is how can we help
and i've asked them to stay uninvolved but attacking my work with them glhf you're bringing it on yourself
it's been several years since i've contributed code this was due to a conflict with an employer i asked for my commit bit to be retired
but all of these attacks of not enough commits or had a dude do it for you or slept with people proves my point thanks for that
i think i got mine because no one else wanted to touch the code i was working with
nope in september
i could not be paid enough to live through my 's again
paypal com
there should be a link to this in the patreon
that's still not my login for freebsd
yup
interesting tho that it still found most of them
laughing my ass off right now at people from github and freebsd telling rogue he's wrong
gamergate do u even github
not entirely accurate if you run strings through bin you'll find freebsd committer names of recent years
you're thinking kernel not userland quite a bit of recent ish freebsd userland exists in osx
it's like christmas
yo
oh go get meat from south
i think it was clefthoof meat
you were the rogue i don't usually wpvp when i'm questing
if i go to gdc and see the dress in any of your slides i am walking out of the talk and directly into the
can wreck rogues when i'm disc not so much as shadow - but all my gear is heals
a bunch of people poked me about some article that was written eh i don't really care that much
i gave it a second glance didn't see anything interesting getting mad about that is like raging at a livejournal post same quality
at least msm manages to do basic fact checking like not confusing with
you know this is like the only time a dude's code was ever incorrectly attributed to a chick ever
morning news included a story about twitter safety shutting down isis accounts because they threatened
i'm not at gdc today but i'll be there tomorrow
well to be more accurate i'll be dropping by tomorrow during lunch hit me up if you want to say hi
i believe so should be a client-side option blocks processing happens client side as well
that's fine
had to put off press photog until today now i'm back to frantically cleaning amp cursing myself for not having time for a haircut
watching gamergate mock women that are concerned about appearing at gdc given the threats they've been inundated w over the past months
gamergate is an intimidation mob speak up get threats amp dog-piled speak about the threats get mocked amp dog-piled
i've got this person blocked please remove me from the conversation
i'm not giving a talk
uber just reported hackers broke into their database this happened last may timely reporting
i'd be down for this
downside of using is that i have to create a new twitter account for each block list
checked the tag w amp w o in place like night amp day guess which led to more productive tweets
meh thanks for the heads up but not too concerned about another angry dude on twitter
this is the same dude that thinks that not being allowed to publish an article to a site he doesn't own is silencing
he was already given my email a while ago by someone else
i like watching logs
what's a decent ror on k s i've averaged over the past few years not sure if that's decent or not
yeah that's including fees fees weren't too bad
yah mgt fund fees are pretty low
if i don't like who you're following i block you if gg doesn't like who you're following they go after your job
bonus points in this thread unreal harassment from gamergate did make abuse more of a topic i suppose
beats me i was sent the screencap
it's human to react negatively to abuse trying to blame someone for reacting to abuse is unsurprisingly a tactic of serial abusers
this is commonly found in cases of domestic violence but it's a favored tactic of gamergate as well
it's another form of abuse but more insidious because the perpetrators think they are the heroes of this story
stand strong the only comfort i have to give right now is that no one is really listening to this particular group anyways
ick dv can happen to anyone
if you're being spammed when reading try using the shared twitter blocklist at http
not all twitter clients apply your blocks to search results however
thanks for the super effective advertising for the need for i guess
not at my computer will report a bug with search amp blocks later not sure if this is intentional or not but it seems sub-optimal
i basically live inside the matrix
hahaha the only anime wall scroll i own is from lain
i thought about putting one of the monitors on top but then it's too high for me to easily see
a comparison to santa would be more apt lots of talk around the blocker tonight
don't feel bad about that unless you've got armor like woah it is soul sucking
soon
mail mostly
it does manage to have a significant amount of overlap with undesirable behavior not related to ethics in games journalism
thank you for the kind words
catching the last bart home so excited what a productive evening
freebsd keeps getting emails about firing me as well y'know the open source os i used to contribute to
dare i say it had fun hanging out with a friend from the igda in a non-igda capacity so very collusion how ethics much wow
amazed gg didn't try to spin it into a win somehow they try to do that with everything
glad that your job is safe
you make the drive to la so tempting

that sounds like the best place to hold a q amp a ever or potentially the most dangerous place
simultaniously exhausted and full of excitement can't decide if i want to jump around and dance or take a nap such a good feeling
being in the public eye means you'll never make everyone happy and that you get put under a microscope even as a minor
the distorting effects of the internet make it even worse relatively minor figures online get scrutiny normally reserved
the ease with which one can dogpile others is scary not least because we all think we're acting as individuals rather th

report it email me tell me if you get no response in a timely manner
when you accidentally open your front camera
it's really hard deciding what to wear for a press release that is going to change everything
obviously a shark costume
so many people are suggesting the wonderwoman outfit but you guys i will be at gdc that sounds awkward
tell her that it's a gaming convention so i'm thinking blackmilk's asteroids dress over leggings with some spikey boots
if i look too fancy it'll be out of place plus i've got facial piercings and bright hair so y'know personal style
yes
haha you have until pst
is amazing 's are bullshit i would never relive my 's
otoh eventually most of them were like wait harper you're randi harper and i still don't know how to adjust to this
when someone uses my last name to introduce or address me i always feel like i'm in trouble
several pairs
hahahahhahaha
we can talk about computers later if it will make you feel better
not giving the talk just going to be there for the fireworks
hit me with your best shot
in honor of all the attending happy
save some ribbons for me
the action may be bad not judging it from my pedestal but seeing multiple people jump on her
it is very appreciated thank you
read this i like this a note on call-out culture via
i dunno i think pc is okay call-out imo has more to do with public callouts which initiate pile-ons
you wish your leggings had game like this
talk to your kids about content management do it while they're still young let my life be a lesson to you
omg anil i am dying you have slain me
this is a museum piece sir
these are museum pieces - if you can find authentic ones it's rare l fits up to like a size
hours and minutes
the swap amp sale page on facebook is realllly good for finding older pieces at normal prices
i am so excited and happy that i want to cry what is this
no pressure
bm is getting closer with their newer lt sizes
but amazon is generally a terrible place to buy any clothing other than socks gt gt
sorry gt gt
i may be off the igda's christmas card list oops you'll be able to make guesses as to why later today
setting up dns and mail forwards and twitter accounts and analytics and trying to do my eye makeup at the same time why is life so hard
i am so fucking excited are you excited
hello grafana graphite statsd server let's set you up again because this will be innnnteresting
yo i use ruby where are my ladies
okay hey tech industry contacts i need to talk to someone from salesforce atlassian and uh yeah that should be good for now
it's the eye makeup that makes it all difficult
this is so weird you guys so weird so awesome if you had asked me a year ago where i would be i never would have guessed
i am hyping the fuck out of this by just being honest and people are setting timers and stuff
hey can you poke the organizer i was thinking about streaming this maybe twitch
although vine may work too since it's like a small part of what you are talking about dunno
not sure about a stream but i'll have at the very least a vine of zoe making the announcement and i'll be livetweeting
file a report with twitter if it's urgent or twitter's abuse system doesn't do anything email me
i'm going to lug my macbook air my ipad my and my surface pro with me i need my battle station this will suffice
my budget is tiny i just got an ipad it was a big expense for me
will need a uh sales contact there for a specific thing can't release info until
will def be getting back to this though i think salesforce will be a good idea for us
email randi at randi io if you need my pager address for urgent concerns i can give that to you
we'll see i'm still figuring out what our tech amp infra concerns are going to be
yeah not good to go assuming all abuse happens around gg that's just not the case
mind hitting me up later this evening or tomorrow will need to talk to someone from sales i think can't give more details yet
hour minutes
can you follow for a dm
ruby's implementation of threading definitely does not get me hot
follow for dm please
so excited i am nauseated oh gosh gosh gosh gosh gosh
wait twitter handles video now what's the recording length limitation

at this point i kinda think you guys are gonna announce half-life d
whatever your announcement is going to be i think it broke reddit
lol sitting next to zynga management
i'm here and i'm hiding because i am literally wearing spoilers for the announcement
just a few minutes until this panel starts zoe goes last making the announcement when she does teasers until then
harassment panel front row
need to sit here with
i don't think i'm going to be able to record so if you could amp post to twitter that would be awesome
listening to talk about how harassment is important and how we are going to help you through it
i'm bringing it up for one reason gamergate has brought harassment into the limelight but rest assured it's always there
it is fitting that we are now seeing these strong women speaking out and trying to fix problems that others are uncertain of how to tackle
oh gosh she mentioned me and in her talk and now i am blushing and trying not to sniffle
in this ongoing tragedy we found our voices amp each other we have learned to work together and to support amp encourage these amazing women
i can't even find the words to describe how much i value the work of the people i've met during this time how much i love all
we talk about gamergate a lot but the truth is gamergate isn't the real battle it's a symptom of a larger problem
online harassment is something most people have faced at some point regardless of their views on ethics in games journalism
it's a really tough problem because it's a big problem it is far reaching it has many different forms
the scope of the problem can discourage people from trying to fight it often this leads to thinking what can i do i'm just one person
you aren't just one person there are many of us and we all have voices but more than that we have resources experience and passion
we have seen so many fantastic things happen out of this tragedy first we have amazing advocacy a voice that is far reaching
we have an invaluable resource that provides emotional support for targets of harassment
both of these organizations have been created to address different aspects of very real problems that affect all of us
it's almost time
soon soon soon
zoe is rocking the stage
today i am happy to announce the online abuse prevention initiative created with amp
oapi is already working with several tech companies to develop amp engineer solutions for social problems we are tech advocates for the user
oapi will be partnering with to provide them with the tools they need
we're creating tools and resources for individuals we're working directly with companies on developer policies to make this a reality
we know what online abuse looks like we've been studying it and we will create reports and publish our findings
i'm so excited about this we're already doing some great things and i can't wait until i'm able to tell you more
hahahaha
we will be releasing as many tools as possible under the bsd license
i'm doing it full time
some of it many moving parts
still figuring that part out i've never been quite in this position things are going to get weird
i don't like the gpl
it's also a license i know well i agree with the philosophy behind it
very cool news from and about preventing online abuse hope this gets real big
it's great to see this being tackled on so many different fronts at once voltron indeed
we should def talk later
agreed
nope
awesome can't wait to hear from you
ty we got that out in a hurry will fix it
you too
we know about the typo and we'll be fixing it we got this together pretty quickly when we finally make a decision we move fast
yes and yes
it doesn't have to be nonprofit you could sell the tears of angry menz i use them to soften leather upholste
there's very little in specifics that i am free to discuss at this point but i can give some overview
just the site
i'm so excited still at gdc stuff is wild
soon we've been working on it gotta move fast

alright time for me to get off the internet and hide for a bit until i manage sleep i'll be getting into gdc late tomorrow
i am so tired barely slept kept waking up to minor adrenaline rush need to move quickly need to get stuff done but really need a nap
that's a scary thought
it is so tempting to wear my wonder woman outfit under my normal clothes today cape management on bart could be challenging
just heard about yesterday well done
i appreciate all of the emails regarding the domain whois info but rest assured this was deliberate
i'm a target regardless and my information was already public i have adequate physical security and the local police know who i am
i do have to go get us an actual business address soon so we can finish with the paperwork to get status so it is all
we'll be making an announcement about that later until paperwork is complete it's all funded by me amp the money from patreon

the morning after hung over struggling to remember how that pile of o'reilly books ended up in your bed what did i code last night
aww i hope things get better over there soon
sam i appreciate you trying to correct people but please drop my mention
oh god did i and frantically checking your shell history to see if you committed something to production
been there
i'll add them to our doc i understand applying for grants is an art so it'll likely take a while for us to get it right
me too i can't wait until i'm free to talk about more
i love your hair
uh yes i will be needing this obviously
rather amused at the uneducated criticism i'm hearing about from gamergate they think a nonprofit means i won't have to pay taxes
i try to make a habit out of not responding to their conspiracy theories but that one was too funny not to share
who puts gamergate on an exam o o
i'm glad it was able to help
bahahaha
i love rock band
packed house for
i need to stop frantically typing up responses to emails to be sent after being reviewed by the rest of my board and get my butt to
for the first time in my months of monitoring this a man momentarily surpassed all the lws in targeted gamergate harassment congrats
are you at gdc
i'm trying to get more insight into trans issues - definitely a group that sees a substantial amount of online harassment
so looking forward to seeing your tweets
uh oh
it begins
i have certain autoblock scripts that run against my own accounts several accounts blocked this morning based on tweets they've sent me
checked a timeline or two just for verification i'm glad my code works as well as it does
mad props to well done
definitely in progress i really want to give a ted talk at some point on engineering tech to solve social problems
presented without comment
yes yes please take my money
how blizzard is taking aim at toxic players in heroes of the storm
i like the way blizzard is tackling toxic players in heroes of the storm it's a good first step
creating a reporting system is difficult because of the human intervention and level of bias that is involved
for more egregious cases for harassment we definitely need to be able to respond to those appropriately but most toxicity isn't this
having a high level of toxicity in your community can lead to more serious cases of harassment and abuse so we need to tackle this head on
putting the tools into the hands of users is a great idea we need more active solutions for protecting ourselves
one of my least favorite things is sending an abuse complaint into the void of a ticketing system and waiting for a human we can do better
the only info i've got is the kotaku article i just rted
difficult to write those with current limitations of developer policy
users want transparency in abuse systems but there's a difficulty in this it can allow people to game the system
gdc has been amazing we've been waiting for this
and that would break developer policy
you can't filter with the exception of blocks
tweetdeck is owned by twitter and was bought around the time that devpolicy was changed
working on it
i am proud to announce this nonprofit organization u r fat god i love working on the internet
you are fucking amazing and i love you
don't put on the cape unless you're ready to be a hero
under my clothes the cape is in my backpack
man still trending people must really love canada jokes
holy crap i just realized my entire apartment is themed her logo colors == my life
this is my work
no remark necessary for this one
we knew when we started this that a movement based on harassment would do anything in their power to stop it
i've got a pretty awesome lawyer working with us
most of tech doesn't really know about gamergate and doesn't care in a bigger sense gamergate has no importance
as an actual irs employee yeah we don't care

stop calling for the head of whoever made that tweet earlier it was retracted that is not a reasonable response
yes it is unfortunate people have strong feelings and let them cloud their judgement
no it wasn't i'm a minority and it was used to try to silence me and other women
i'm not just referring to you also you are not tim
yeah we should talk i was just about to send an email over to them right before i was told it was retracted
you rock i got a text about it at a very inopportune time was all awww hell not now
people are making an interesting case irt libel and some things gg is saying about oapi but honestly my dance card is already full
that's awesome yeah i'm not really bothering to read gg's response - although people send me snippets
they don't know what we're doing and they have no power outside of being a distraction
i had that for a while in the beginning but now i have code that keeps track of all of it for me if it's needed
it's like reading tabloids easy to spend too much time reading garbage instead of doing cool things
absolutely i'm still cracking up that the one time i wear a superhero cape on bart i run into someone that i sorta know
oapi and yes we are partnered with crash but they are victim advocates we work more with tech amp directly with tech cos
we'll have more info out about this soon
i need to post this again because i keep re-reading this article and going squeeeeee
read the last line of the paragraph about oapi out loud to a table full of indie devs at dinner tonight love it
oh well
honestly i forgot his name doesn't really matter i'm working with real data scientists
is my favorite
it's entertaining but well let's just say my entire next week is quickly filling with meetings no time for gamergate
i got some insight into the indie gaming community tonight just a peek it was enlightening
a lot of indie game devs remind me a lot of foss devs it's about that passion i'm drawn to passion kind of in love with all
hoping we'll be able to release more info soon lots of stuff in the works i promise big things
i'll keep that in mind at some point i could see it going there - but not on our roadmap for at least months
gdc was great today thank you for letting me be a small part of your world but it's time literally take off my cape and go to
ok yeah no gdc today coughing too much to do next week can't risk full-blown consars
gg has already started flooding the irs proving that they have no idea that it is impossible get the irs to do what you want them to
how do i even have an ear ache i am not
oof i'm missing bummer
tempting i chef community so much but given my focus is moving away from devops seems like funds should go to someone else
ooo i might actually do that
thanks
a lot of people contribute just a little bit and it turns into enough to keep me afloat every dollar is immensely appreciated
that does not look organic or grass fed take it back
i thought the same thing
purchased from sock dreams sadly
it is absurd how much of my amazon wish list consists of socks
if you are a fan of fun socks check out anything by blue q
i have those
hahaha my favorite thing ever is shopping for fun socks
big shout out to for doing it right and doing right by trans people
why am i not on the list
thank you for the personal story you related it was touching
seriously you're going to make me cry
p s blizzard makes the best games
awesome
email me this so i can get to it currently in my car
we'll have quite a few more citations soon including official text defining oapi's relationship with con
ewwww i saw this on my phone so didn't see the salvation army logo
first its triggering second its an inaccurate portrayal of partner violence third its tacky
a fan attending lists all they don't like about the industry it seems to be all the good things
for now i have to resist answering over twitter it'll be quoted by press need to have the rest of oapi involved in statements
i had a migraine until we made the announcement then all the feels in the past few days have me wanting to cry all the time good
then i got sick but i have work to do solution i just went out and bought a lb brisket all problems can be solved with
that's never a problem
the real work is just getting started
keep in mind that promoted tweets don't have to be timeline tweets
seeing a lot of talk about gdc vs pax i felt safer at gdc post-gamergate than i did at pax pre-gamergate so there's that
no
hey that party at gdc right after promoting not cool
not cool
same i recently bought their kingpin card i always buy nvidia
anything i say publicly gets quoted by the press randi io
do you realize how creepy and inappropriate that tweet is
yo check out it has helped me so much with eyestrain
ah i don't sit and think the pacing amp ranting helps me
eek also hi i followed you because you're awesome
since i'm joining the startup scene it seems like a bad thing that i'm looking forward to season of silicon valley but it looks so good
the empty chair - - gdc
that was a comment taken from polygon's article on the panel
i'm glad to hear that you are so supportive of women and condemn the constant stream of harassment they receive
need a way to switch btwn sets of tabs have a bunch of tabs open for a wow addon i'm writing that creates goog calendar for garrison
probably not going to be working on that for another few weeks time to switch to running a non-profit set of tabs
i'm mostly pondering a few startup incubators that are now accepting non-profit applications
oapi coverage in wsj venturebeat more good mention here
wait which enforcer
disclosure i'm an ex-enforcer
i am not surprised in the slightest i wish that i was
keep in mind that pa put a sexual predator in charge of security and then brushed it under the rug yrs ago
sickened but not surprised by what happened at pax earlier today pax has a history of making poor decisions at the cost of women's safety
please stop including me in that post i use it for reference but i used to live with her and we
are not exactly on speaking terms
i don't tend to talk about it much personal info
who doesn't love hugs hugs are one of my favorite things
here's an idea how about the ability to mute someone for n period of time
so it would auto-unmute after n hours or whatever
yeah it was pretty accurate i don't see why that dude thought that these were bad things
iirc tweetbot is a paid app i'm not necessarily thinking full-fledged client
ooo i like that
built-in would be good i can do more with rd party services than i can by providing a client in the meanwhile
tweetbot is a paid client
that is a lot harder developer policy prohibits it
not fond of the idea of creating features with a money barrier
i'm also quite curious about this and wondering about the radio silence from
blocked you i thought she blocked someone else
all of us right now where have you been all our lives
except that features like that shouldn't have a pay barrier
women at gdc share heartbreaking stories this is how chooses to respond
i'm pushing more for these to be options added by twitter or using free scripts
i've just seen way to many abuse preventatives lately that suggest some sort of pay wall can't get behind that
revenge porn dude is hilarious if you listen to him he thinks large tech companies shouldn't exist
if you talk to people it's called collusion not conversation get it right
that's his original account renamed
it looks like ethicsed all over the place again
hmm that tweet may be actionable
can you send it up i'm not exactly at my computer right now
yo you're enforcing at pax this year right can you find a person
i don't think so it was just found
thanks appreciated
ok - i have to say that i at least love how they are sticking to the correct pronoun
he thinks the entire world should be indies
im sorry wat
oooo almost forgot need to submit to cfp for
my bot
ughhhh now to decide what to submit gt gt
i think i had him muted because he was misconfigured to randomly tweet at me
apparently not
and this is why i hate that bot because it's a misconfigured pos that doesn't have ebooks in it's name
don't do dumbass things i kicked the bot
needs to rename the bot to something ebooks and this wouldn't be a problem
i stand by
i know you're going through a lot right now i can help with some of this dm or email randi at
database queries as social justice
this is awesome and i love this
turning it into a block list could be pretty rad too
i still don't understand the whole white knight things knights get land armor sword horse who wouldn't want this land in sf
there's one particular person that has tweeted about me more than times in the past hours this has been her pattern for the week
i'm not really concerned when it comes to gaters being gatery about me but regarding this org that's a problem
i've been mostly ignoring it but she's clearly fixated and making weird accusations has never once directly talked to me
i suppose i have to get used to the idea of bloggers using my name to get hits but slightly irritated
eh this is turning into more of a legal concern
no doubt i don't really have the time for lawsuits so it's a question of resource allocation vs benefit
on one hand the only voice she has is with gaters - which doesn't really affect oapi's reach
but on the other hand it sends a message and i'm not used to having to be concerned about an org's image vs my own
i started putting pocky through my lip rings that seems reasonable
so much pocky
storing it for later
so it causes problems with other bots
matcha
well i bought a case of it sooo
what does that have to do with anything
we've got a pr firm i might toss this their way
i am right now watching enforcers defend chums on facebook
this is a conversation i had with one of chums friends earlier today
i'm watching enforcers say that they knew it was only a matter of time until this happened still nothing was done
dude stop snapping at me what is your deal
ok whenever you've calmed yourself poke me on facebook and i'll tell you why it's a problem w the code base
but right now i'm dealing with friends getting rape and death threats so sorry your anger isn't really a big deal later
hey if you toss me more info about that i can pass it up the chain to enforcer type people it would be appreciated
hi ex-enforcer her enforcers are now paid they didn't used to be but then state law required it
it's minimum wage this started happening about years ago i think
thanks it is appreciated
omg i am laughing so hard right now
given the changes in recruiting i'm not really surprised it was already going downhill
a community is generally great at policing itself but not once the well is already poisoned or something
happy to discuss on facebook in pm but not publicly calling out their names on twitter it would be a bad idea
yo bby i'm chaotic good
wait which d amp version
i just couldn't ever develop lasting romantic feelings for anyone that prefered d amp th edition over
th edition doesn't exist we don't speak of that
i hate shadowrun
it's like d amp for peasants
i have the fitbit aria scale it's a wifi scale logs to internet which is awesome but not for the reasons you'd think
you are married young miss go hither
i'm a monogamous girl in a polygamous world
but does it scale
that was my intention
meh i have a couple of pathfinder modules but it's not really my thing
mayyybe i don't like virtual d amp i can't literally set things on fire and cause havoc
i almost typed is it in the cloud forgetting that i have keyboard input word replace for cloud to butt
i can't play this game drunk
perl requires little logic
totally got the flag
this guy has on his serious face
i love what they've done with trolls
i got spells for that
so ready
selfies are rad
one more bg before bed
if you get a follow from yes that is me being a ceo is scary and i want a private account for yelling
right now multiple browsers i should set up tweetdeck for this
chrome now supports having user profiles as well i switch back and forth for a few different things it's useful
i'm starting to do more stuff that is team-based though so i'm thinking tweetdeck is the way to go
i am sorry journalists but this is kind of a place for me to just vent gt gt i like you i really do but not for this
yeah it's pretty rad for managing multiple accounts in various services
this one is more official-ish less tweets i think i'm still figuring out my role as ceo amp keeping normal persona
also a few famous people followed me and now i'm freaking out that i tweet too much amp don't want to scare them off
that's how it works with a private account
i wonder if has seen this
tweetbot is a paid client
aw gt gt
got a mention on tech news night on not accurate but close enough in
sometimes
eh i knew she'd take credit for me utilizing my old work account but i can't really let gg affect my life decisons
but regardless i don't need to see her crud linked she's picking targets to gain supporters old news
we should have some more info posted about oapi soon lots of questions about if we are hiring glad to see people so excited
time to learn the art of writing to apply for grants seems like different orgs prefer drastically different styles high level vs detailed
steak
speaking of which i was able to oom my servers with that script hehe
obama just said user face desginer - oh no no no no
someone please tlel me i heard that wrong i had my face buried in my coffee cup
i heard it correctly
breaking from the whitehouse user face designer is now a tech job title
seriously how am i the only person that caught this this just confirms my belief that i'm the only person that watches the morning news
my nickname is grandma gt gt
yessss quiet fist pump i am a trendsetter
dad
my kingdom for a subscription to safari books online i miss having one provided by my former employer
i didn't read them i was sent a few screencaps which is why i was a bit concerned
there are some statements made which are obvious slander ie what i do with funds w patreon wth claims of fraud
but given that these people seem to not understand the difference between charity and npo why bother giving them my time
the only thing that's really concerning is that she's stalkerish in her obsession reminds me of dude that showed up at my work
and that shit freaks me out not that she would likely do anything but that she could rile someone up enough to do something
i don't think i've ever even directly mentioned her username tho but i'm sure she'll still yell dogpile
i guess he was trying to say that - who knows
won't work = charity
always
i guess i've been doing a good enough job that a pua mra site decided i was public enemy something to write home about
i think this is spam i'm not sure what i'm reading but it's funny
redis is overkill for what i'm doing i want something more portable daemonless
ooo that's old school i didn't even think of that
wow this looks perfect
bahah google suggestions knows what's up
full blown redis is overkill for what i'm doing will try this out
wat
you are one of my favorite people bby
have realized that hours in my logic goes to hell and it's all rabbit holes and uncommitted code good reason to take a break
trying to get used to putting together and sticking to a project roadmap since i'll likely be working with others on this soon
trying to play nicely with others on the same areas of code is a learning experience devops did not prepare me for this
or many dkim setups for that matter
woah i just went to go prod sarah jeong to see if i could ask her a legal question and saw she was gone hope everything is
does anyone know if she's alright
oh good was really worried
oooh did you see you had a fan account
oh yeah it's his seconds of fame he's still hurting after a bunch of senior tech people ripped his work apart
jira bitbucket
going to mountain view today can't wait horrid drive but having introductory meetings in person is so much better than phone
entire article attached rt lol
great article wired curbing online abuse isn't impossible here's where we start
they have been testing perfecting a terrorism formula to ruin target's lives attempt to get them murdered or drive them to ki
first step is doxxing and death threats which immediately destabilizes the target's most fundamental sense of safety and secu
it creates the isolation needed for longer-term campaigns of threatening abusive harassing messages per hour to have
they then start digging in detail through your past to find invent things to justify harassing you and get more ammo
this has the nice bonus effect of proving to your community that you deserve harassment and aren't worth supporting = more
that campaign signals to any stalkers past partners etc that now is the time to get them this often means cyber sexual ass
if anyone is defending you at this point the same techniques are applied to supporters to make sure that stops
the message is clear this target will be left completely isolated as we torture terrorize and abuse them with impunity
this systemized terrorism creeps closer and closer into the tech community we are becoming the new hunting grounds
we have been ignoring this because it was happening to the most marginalized users of our software and tools
i'm in south bay and available after pm if any other companies people would like to meet up
gaters have started spamming instead of this account it's cool i'm modifying ggautoblocker to use mute just for that acct
lol what
this reminds me of barrens chat
reported reported for reporting reported for reporting my report
did you say thunderfury blessed blade of the windseeker
i'm around
no u
the more companies i talk to the more i realize we're going to need employees - and a steady form of funding to pay them excited
just need to figure out a way to hire people without disclosing their names publicly for security reasons is that a thing llc
if the past mo have taught us anything it's that attaching your name to anti-harassment gets yourself targeted for more harassment
that's a relief
yeah that's my only concern being a nonprofit gives us a lot of restrictions
nonprofits have weird restrictions i'm still learning the ropes i just assume everything is going to be difficult
i have one i just have to talk to them mostly musing
i think the biggest challenge going forward in the near future is going to be securing funding
a big project we have going forward is a user facing solution that involves the cooperation of large tech companies
i don't have a problem getting tech companies involved the concern is just funding everything
i need to be less uncomfortable talking about money i don't like asking for it really bad at that
i don't have to do it but given that it's such a high priority i need to put some time into it until we have it
i can't wait it's going to be awesome great meeting with you
yay thank you i missed you and i worried
nowhere yet have to secure funding before hiring
that would be amazing
like i would owe you big time
if i see more chief diversity officer talking about st amendment rights while not protecting victims of harassment i might get angry
yup clemson uni
bringing a care package to a friend in the hospital as one does
i shitposted in barrens chat not even gonna lie
in wod you see manrik and his wife as children come baaaaack
this guy is comedy gold and popehat is encouraging him wtf smh
i love
sigh
haha welllllll i'm usually here so you know whenever you're in town hit me up i miss you
yup lots of references to things from classic i love wod
why interact with these people
gamergate is again talking abt sending my employer emails to get me fired guys i'm the founder ceo i look forward to chatting with you
not sure was sent screencap
that's basically how a few orgs contacted about me have responded
i'm staring at that bowl cursing myself for leaving engineering and going into npo which does not allow me to purchase ridiculous things
because of the price which is not a legitimate reason
eh that's because they are all young and don't realize that people learn amp mature with time
yesssss
today in things gamergate does to try to stop oapi they link to quotes of things i used to believe that i admitted to on my own blog
awkward but it's a good case study on how fygm is common in but not insurmountable people can learn
and oh boy did i have a lot of apologies to make eventually luckily tech feminists are pretty awesome amp forgiving people
no idea it's not going to work very well the same show where i made those quotes is having me on again in a month
i've been told i'm pretty good at drumming up suspense
y'know if i keep making announcements during shows events it seems like that could make the press nervous i guess
it could go either way i'm not very predictable
i love
wow this is great
of it is private info i've even blogged about this but you mouthbreathers can't read i guess none
i just assume this is going to lead to fighting someone outside a pub
what is modtalkleak
meh you're probably right i just keep seeing references to it so i was curious
where's the file
magnificent
there is no official response i've talked to pds it's officer discretion most officers will not say this
i'm pondering getting leo a friend looking at shelter pics of the most adorable corgi chihuahua mix right now omg omg omg
sigh prob w being a public figure which you are like it or not is that when you say shit like this it causes a storm
a figurative storm of shit - a shitstorm if you will - that is now causing people to get harassed
i don't disagree with your point i don't frequent reddit at all because it's basically circlejerks
and now mods of ghazi are under fire by a mob that appears to have been led by you
i'm not sure where it started but it's not going anywhere good
my feelings exactly
i support ghazi as one of the few safe venting spaces for many people that are victims of gamergate's harassment
blizzard makes halflife
something that needs to be addressed for sure
you should bring those up with the mods they are receptive
i don't have to listen to you on my personal account you have no idea what oapi is for or doing shove off
i left engineering to go into running a non-profit huge pay decrease you're absurd
yep randi io
yes i know about 's account it's being looked into
oh shit i accidentally blocked you whoops
it's a valuable resource for victims of harassment so no
i sometimes post to ghazi i'm fond of the community's irc channel it's a place to be supported
ghazi has been criticized a few times in the past and every time they reacted by reasonably discussing amp adapting
they make mistakes sometimes but they are good people and they try to do what's right i support them
i'll likely be able to do a bit better than that but not even close to money i made as a senior engineer
why would anyone want to hire a rockstar anything i've seen the movies this just leads to problems with cocaine
will never stop laughing
i require the sauce for this gif someone help
cannot headdesk hard enough
thank you
i suspect she doesn't know about either connection but it's the site she's posting to lol
thank you everyone that pointed out it's from tswift's shake it off this video is my new favorite thing
i'm trying to get work done but this is a problem
uh random what are you talking about
revenge porn and doxxing was just banned from twitter
doesn't work if the people are already following you either
doesn't work i don't take requests
oh no so worried totes shaking why care
holy shit there were just like shots it seems like an officer was shot shit officers have guns drawn this is crazy
guns drawn ferguson pd
another set of officers just arrived guns drawn and police dog all went up the hill ferguson pd
and i are safe we are outside hiding behind the concrete officer is bleeding badly but i'm not posting unedit
every time they discover anything it's either incorrect or something i've said publicly on my blog they are useless
whoa just got her camera taken for evidence
i'm disappointed i've never been in a group dm with you
kids these days will never know open wifi with everything going over http and net send oh my god net send what glo
http going over wifi has ended relationships ah the early 's wardriving those were the days
this is how you get a follow
lrt i cannot stop laughing damn it taylor
stop making out with my bot
lol as they should gg is a hate group ghazi isn't for them
last retweet
amused at how popular this tweet was that was unexpected
not yet all talk no email
top kek
i have an ipad iphone appletv macbook air come at me bruh
getting a puppy today getting a puppy today getting a puppy today getting a puppy today getting a puppy today getting a puppy today getting
let me tell you how horrifically -shocked- i am that this indiegogo has been delayed i hate crowdfunded tech
you can turn the speakers off and i will be wearing these
aw are your jimmies rustled
yup
yes there is you illegitimate cockwaffle stay in school
watching gaters confuse and while screetching at just another morning
you have to follow some pretty heinous people to get on ggautoblocker that list isn't public
frankly i'm quite amazed that i'm not on theblockbot yet
i am glad i was able to contribute in some small way to your thursday curtsies
rofl hey guys guys guys i've got something to make you giggle violates the logan act
i live in san francisco i don't judge
a really bad data scientist that is yelling about harassment because i pointed out flaws in his work lololol
after he tried pulling the you don't need to be here woman because i'm so senior and i've already done this
the sourcelist is now dynamically generated it's not that different from the github list though
today's goal get g'gater to urge use of logan act against dissenters on grounds that is a foreign government diffic
i can never tell anymore
the text shown in the image was not satricial that dude is dead serious and not a scientist
ggautoblocker has been absorbed by oapi it's been rewritten in ruby will have a new project out soon
it has ties to other unpublished projects need to publish them all at once
uh excuse me that is the best kind of logan
people think that implying association via follow is a bad thing but it's shockingly accurate
wait what
i'm just fast
my name is spelled with an i you idiot
jesus the one thing that starbucks amp people sending me threats have in common they can never spell my first name
i'm sorry but i've received quite a flurry of threats i've asked these people to form an orderly line and you're in back
awww someone's mad
why starbucks spells your name wrong-
shhh you're going to hurt their narrative
really really really want to go to blizzcon but not sure how i'm going to afford it this year
ouch
there is sometime at this shelter that is waiting to see the same puppy i want death match in the streets
oh god i was first i have dibs if i take this puppy i'm going to feel like such an asshole
i am an asshole
police officer just told me you are not an asshole all is fair in love and puppies
i can travel tickets i can't afford can likely find a hotel to crash in
aaand the owners just walked in to claim the puppy the police are not happy
bummed that i lost out on this adorable puppy but glad the original owners were able to reclaim her
a little concerned at what is happening here uh this story may not be over
i guess the police have a history with this person repeatedly losing their dogs or something something bad has them very unhappy
so i don't get that puppy but the director is apologetic and telling me i can have off any other dog
the officer looks ready to cry
this is the most drama i have ever seen about a dog
i've been reassuring him and the family that it's okay - losing a dog would have been devastating to that family
there is another puppy
sadly most are breeds not allowed by my apartment complex
about to meet this puppy shepherd mix a bit bigger than i wanted we'll see
loool
no puppy today this puppy had some pretty severe anxiety issues i can work with that but leo would not be happy
i'd be happy to get an adult but leo wouldn't adjust well he thinks he is dominant to everything can't have a big dog he gets protective
i've worked with a lot of abused dogs in the past used to do a lot of work training w anxiety amp behavioral issues
walked out of the shelter with no puppy but now i have a date uh success has many definitions
me too
i am exhausted puppy journey is not over it has just begun
the puppy i almost got
wait the story still isn't over the search continues may be visitng another puppy tonight cocker spaniel mix
oh that weird rt
on my way to bart to pick up a puppy from some dude from craigslist if i die you can all fight over my shit
he's a maltese cocker spaniel mix
kernighan thrall riker or nimoy
nimoy is not crate trained whelp it's going to be a long night
thise noises while he is wagging his tail wtf
er those
this is mine
i played the video for him and he stopped
people keep asking me about the stuff i posted about that site amp ties to rooshv dun dun dunnnnnn
then this happened
dogs are good for that
how the hell did i get in here minutes ago
leo still isn't sure what to make of nimoy i think they'll get along well eventually once he stops being afraid to play
stacks upon stacks of oreilly books what you can barely see is robot parts hanging down
the dog manages to fit himself into tiny crates
as someone that is continuing to be harassed by ed since it was formed over a decade ago can confirm
going to become besties i can tell
the puppy is trying to hump leo and leo is just like excuse me and now i have a lb lapdog
it's incorrect it's in no way related to email addresses are these people technical
it's tied to twitter user ids and it's not a constant update it updates when i run it
why are these people such idiots i mean seriously it's not difficult code to read
furthermore blockbot isn't even my code ggautoblocker is blockbot is by someone else
llap
if i had a dollar for everytime someone confused with i could pay for blizzcon
yo i really hate to burst your bubble but you found a bug in twitter's ui the block still exists
congrats on finding that bug i'm sure gamergate is totes going to care
it's not true see last tweets
to reiterate some gater thought they found a way to exploit the block system and make themselves unblockable by changing their email x
it didn't work
twitter's ui bugs out all the time it wasn't a surprising bug i'd be willing to bet it's not replicatable
maltese cocker spaniel mix
i'll admit i googled too
lots more to come i'm sure
new life mantra
you live in my area how did i not know this let's get wine and cheese gether
search doesn't filter blocks by default it should imo
had to put a blanket over his crate but nimoy slept through the night
yup my other dog's name is leo
at the very least questions will be raised and we now understand that women in our industry must choose between incompeten
i'm not a journalist buttwrangler
siiiiiiigh
we've kinda got a system worked out he sits his butt on my desk front legs around my neck and i try to type around his wagging
no nimoy my face is clean stahp
in case you think i'm joking
why won't she let me sit in her lap too
awww you are both adorable
focus is split between the dog noses and the fact that i really need pants that don't fall down
it's one of my favorite things
awwwww
heheheh literal wrangling of butts
all of them
i will create a literal wall
seriously though my apartment is scary awesome covered in so much blizz star trek star wars schwag
discrimination
why do you hate freedom
it's hard for me to find good marvel schwag i've got a nice print from target lol but dc sadly does better mechandising
i have some pretty fantastic wonderwoman stuff but i prefer marvel hands down dc chars seem to emo
er too
these guys finally exhausted themselves yay quiet time
an old friend just posted this on facebook
goes well with leo
no
leo doesn't like sharing but he's learning
yesterday's not like other girls are today's not your shields same shit different day
press requests need to come in through press org
shhhh
i am not the current sysinstall maintainer my sysinstall isn't even in use anymore
ggers joke about target's children mark kern freedom of expression will you join us repeat
kern was joking about triggering people the other day yeahhh kern went full gater big surprise
i miss sysinstall
i didn't realize you followed
let's not forget kern is the person that said he was fully invested in anti-harassment remember the cape comment i made
there is no circumstance in which threatening children is considered ok there is no circumstance in which triggering is ok
ah well no one's perfect
to reiterate gamergate is threatening 's children and is totally ok with this because free speech
instead he tries to turn this into if you're not with gamergate you're against freedom of expression - uh no we're against assholes
you can express yourself as an asshole but that doesn't give you freedom to not be called on it
i'm against gamergate because i'm for freedom of expression gamergate is all about using fear to suppr
i know my heart is breaking not really i do tweet a lot
wonderwoman suit by blackmilk
blackmilk is amazing have you seen them before
mark kern is the dictionary definition of 'willfully dense'
as someone that's been targeted for a while by these fuckheads yeah it is a threat
anytime they bring your family into it it's meant to keep you quiet
to remind you what you have to lose this is all context and knowing how they are
a lot of us are like fuck everything i'm gonna yell - but families are still vulnerable
for futher context these are the same people that started going through my facebook friends
and started naming listing people because i wasn't backing down
this is also the same guy that posted my home address on twitter heh
probs not
fwiw i'm usually pretty careful about calling for the head of anyone
i've made mistakes in the past and learned from them
amazon knows me better than any ex-boyfriend ever did these are my shopping suggestions
please rt
grummz realized that no one would pat him on the back for not being an asshole but gg would worship him for joining
bam
oh my god
maybe some people like stepping on legos i don't judge
line piece
i cheated on helvetica with comic sans and i'm not sorry
obviously
i already bought it
blame for writing it
yo the tweet i made about the tetris book just got retweeted by boing boing
oooo i'm looking forward to seeing that
no more discrimination against l blocks
forever
if you have them contact me directly i may be able to help
the days where i accidentally type 'to' intead of 'too' are horrid
pssst if you're going to stalk my timeline when i have you blocked it's closer to k followers
nice cropping of tweets too but the truth hurts
gamergate loves to flood so we won't see any legitimate harassment complaints that come in
it's unfortunate because i'd like to leave twitter as an avenue available to gamergaters that have been targeted
but i'm going to have to mass-mute or mass-block gamergate would prefer that we aren't able to help their own people
we may be setting this up at some point in the future have to be really careful though
a high risk gamergate will do anything they can to try to harm oapi because anti-harassment is a bad thing i guess
unfortunately no text filters are too high-risk
i don't think you understand what gaslighting means but that's adorable
omg you guys they are misusing the word gaslighting repeatedly must not have gotten to that on their sjw word of the day calendar yet
as gamergate has repeatedly proven linking a url doesn't mean shit for comprehension
manual filter tweets
there's a lot of sarcasm and doublespeak in this group especially appropriation of terms text filters just don't work
i can't really hate the kids i mean they are just young stupid uneducated no life experience who hasn't been there
i call out people like jenn because she is causing problems by flooding join oapi it's moronic
these are the types of tweets i get anytime mentions me but it's really about ethics in journalism
literally no idea what you are talking about i block eggs though
yup and she rarely tells them to stop
hi this isn't targeted harassment it is not direct nor specific you're encouraging mass reporting
please stop encouraging an abuse of the reporting system
excuse me while i bite your butt
it's blurry because they were spinning in circles
take him back
i would rather lose k followers by standing up for others in a bad position than gain by keeping my mouth shut fo
hah and i get worried when i do it perspective
hopefully you didn't get spammed with notifications
oh this is bad this is really really bad cw sexual assault dc comics hey dc is bad content for some
i haven't seen anything that falls under the lines of targeted harassment in any screenshots archives
however their accounts were mass-reported just asking you to not encourage this
wut
i use it on aws constantly but that's probably not helpful anything dell tends to work fairly well though
did you read the text of the article that picture is really creepy triggering as fuck
i'm aware i've read that story arc
the killing joke was a fucked up story arc in general amp could have been written better
the fact that it's canon doesn't make it better dc should stay the fuck away from that
many people would be scared amp triggered by that cover
a bit of both perhaps def yes on the cover maybe on the content
i don't like the women in refrigerators trope at all but i'm not going to say those comics shouldn't exist
but the cover itself - well the tweets capped in that article do a better job explaining than i could
watch to see just a few more minutes
you changed your hair
nimoy you fucking pleb don't you even watch star trek
oapi got a mention on kotaku
excuse me kotaku but i am a devops not just an activist
fuck who am i
content warning
oh good lord
it is trolling
guys calm down it was a joke
mutual follower collusion
nothing changes unless we make it change nothing fixes itself ignoring it is like trying to throw a tarp over a bear
positivity's cool but make sure you're not doing it on the backs of people who are still hurting amp struggling to make
no not really if i wasted all my time paying attention to gamergate i wouldn't get shit done
i get where you are coming from and it's annoying to be sure but it's not considered harassment under twitter's tos
mean words aren't harassment they aren't direct and specific threats
gt gt i did a cw
to be fair of those things have anything to do with twitter's tos or even free speech for that matter none
fortunately we've got controls on twitter like block and mute which keep us from seeing most things we don't like
oh gosh if only that had been parody
i only have a bajillion jira tickets to get through tonight then it's arenas in wow cracks knuckles let's do this
i love atlassian
if that were the case twitter would probably have about of the current userbase
i get your frustrations really i do i deal with the same stuff every day on my own account
but sadly reporting just isn't the answer blocks mutes amp ignoring is the best way to go
everything right now i'm mostly in love wiht my ele sham spriest but disc for s
for my small org it works amazingly well has everything to do with configuration i love the vcs integrations
branch management and tying commits into a specific ticket == amaze
man i cannot figure out how to pve as disc now that atonement is so nerfed
or perhaps twitter's userbase and humanity at large everyone's a jerk sometimes
killing you how
it's the first time since december nd when i started monitoring that gg has complained more about a male
mentions of + the hashtag surpassed that of anita zoe bri myself history congrats tim
that would be awesome i'm doing pretty well in lfr for shadow usually in top dmg and i'm in mostly pvp gear
but lfr is derp
truth be told i've only done normal raiding a handful of times all in wod it went ok once i knew the strat pvp is harder
there was one where there's like this dude he's big and the hands out of the ground
i kept being the last person alive and topping damage it's like what this isn't hard
this is in wod
veeerrry slowly ok now stop dots sorry i couldn't help myself
basically my life
yup i have a major problem with dc and their treatment of women
and when you have marginalized traumatized members of your own group telling you they're hurt or uncomfortable you liste
will keep that in mind
i highly doubt most women scare as easily as you
lol
cannot stop laughing at that guy
it definitely alienates female readers if that's what they are going for oh wait it's dc yup
people confuse empathy with being scared and that says more about them than anything
things i am scared of small red lights in dark rooms drive through carwashes large spiders not being able to afford blackmilk
things i am not scared of whiny manbabies a lot of twitter mentions public speaking perl standing up for those that are afraid feels
yeah i get threats and it means i have to be cautious but really i'm crazy enough to think i'm unbreakable which is why this works
i could get hurt someone could come after me hell people have shown up at my office before i've been doxxed i've been threatened
so i don't think about it instead i use it as fuel i'd rather try to fix this so others don't have to go through this too
that's why we have because going on the internet without fearing for your life should be a basic human right
combating online harassment doesn't mean jerks won't exist everyone is a jerk sometimes but you shouldn't ever be afraid
online harassment takes many forms some is actionable by the service provider tos or law enforcement
never feel bad about that it's pretty intense if you're not prepared for it
it takes a pretty specific personality type to be able to take this shit on voluntarily
there's no one-size-fits-all answer for online harassment but we're in this for the long haul we've got ideas we will help
i went through that my first night talking about gg when baldwin started tweeting at me good lord that was a bit intimidating
we're already privately working with a number of tech companies relationships are being built we're making huge amounts of progress
i can't wait until we're in a position to be able to share more details but not yet it's early days
if your company has an abuse social media or community team we want to talk all industries welcome info org
i sort of grew up in it
holy shit
yo who do i know at i can never recall names + employers
hm there's another person i usually chat with not ranjib - ughhhh
possibly did it go to my personal email or oapi
i'm drowning in email we just started inputting them into a ticketing system to get through 'em
oh i think i remember yeah i will fwd this on to our oapi ticketing system so we can start to respond
even though i tweet a lot hehe
searched freebsd code for twitter name they didn't get any results and used it as evidence she doe
don't forget we don't even use git that's an export we use svn
i use windows
i think so
i have a good lawyer as well as people on my board that have been in nonprofits before it helps a lot
ran it by lawyer as well as far as me promoting my personal funding sources in the meanwhile being very cautious to keep it legal
if i wasn't surrounded by such great people there's no way i'd be able to get this thing off the ground
yo appreciate the shout out for ggautoblocker but article is technically incorrect
just users doesn't do text parsing i know article is a bit old but wanted to throw that out there
tug of war
not sure about classic but it's definitely a stuffed hedgehog
these guys won't let me work
devops forever
sure if you have any questions feel free to throw them my way randi org
no rush or anything like i said it's been up for a while i just noticed though
from wa yeah you can easily do it in days i'd recommend taking a break just after hitting the ca border
i haven't used it gt gt
sounds about right just getting to the border is good enough stop by the diner in weed ca for breakfast
yup i'm aware
men are the ones that are going to push the real change they are the ones in power generally we need their help
but they have to follow not lead women know the issues they face better than men listening is important
at least i'm assuming that's what it was i read paragraphs got bored and deleted the message don't know the guy
i saw the kobane clip it was daesh lies
nope reported by multiple sources
there were no us commandos
that was because isis were watching the new cantlie propaganda film in the cultural center when they hit it microbrain
it's a staged escorted report done at gunpoint are you dumb enough to give that credibility
lol a staged escorted video shot at gun point how stupid can you get
murdering muslims every day is the only way isis can keep control
why were innocent civilians in prison
it's islam aftermath microbrain it's always been that way
this story isn't going away isis reportedly incinerate dead fighters suspected of contracting ebola http
any time i see an article by the lowlife scumbag pilger i know the opposite is true
if that is your count then the amount of muslims in the world is one tenth of what is claimed
here is an isis medical student at work
you are the one with the conspiracy theories the turkish army collaboration has been proven multiple times
blows up in
barbarism today what's left of nabi shiyt shrine in after state terrorists demolish it
seems like everything get's stuck at sinjar and kobane
the idea that the us is trying to provoke russia in light of russian invasion of crimea and e ukr is absurd
pilgars repetition of the russian propaganda line about ukrainian nazis is an insufferable lie
pilgar is a lying low life piece of dog shit and there is no other way to put it
pilgar sides with communists authoritarian dictators and terrorist in every single case
some day i will go out of my way to piss on his grave
anyone who believes that you can have compromise or power sharing with people of an absolutist islamic mindset is delusional
there was no us coup in ukraine microbrain
there were never any neo nazis involved that is simply russian propaganda
it goes on the assumption that the admiration of stephan bandera means support for a nazi ideology false
bandera's joining with nazis was to rid ukraine of soviets and had no relationship to him supporting ideology
same applies to th waffen ss they fought for nazis to get rid of soviets they never had
nazi ideological indoctrination and wiki will tell you that half the world's neo nazis live in russia
borrowed from q on startrek
it is the same mindset of all islamic terrorist groups and there are over of them
again you jump to unsupported conclusions just like your absurd coup idea
rofl you really do have more than one screw lose
sanctions didn't kill anyone birdbrain there were no sanctions against iraq buying food you people are as deluded as ever
and you pick the same old lying scab until you finally die
the problem is in your lie that the deaths were caused by us sanctions purchase of food by iraq was never sanctioned
they learn it from the quran and hadiths like these
sorry twitter missed on sending that tweet answer should now be present
okay microbrain show me proof that the sanctions included food or medicine and stop babbling about experts
rofl genocide denier lol okay i didn't realize i was talking to the lunatic left fringe have a nice day
wikipedia says that there were no sanctions against food and medicine try again microbrain
not only were there no sanctions against food and medicine but sadam was allowed to sell oil in exchange for food amp medicine
i guess while your trying to shove your sanctimoniousness at people you can't read your forehead
who cares about some loony opinions the facts are that there were no sanctions against food or medicine any idiot can verify
we are not arguing deaths we are arguing the cause sadam was the cause not sanctions
no like the idiot leftist that you are you believe that endless repetition constitutes truth
just drone mindlessly on if you like by now you could have actually brought some facts to the table but you have none
repeating as everyone knows is your way of saying that you just sit around and repeat the bs of your left wing clones
so where is your evidence of the intentional destruction of water give me a link to facts not opinions
to divide
again like an idiot you give the opinions of people like you with no facts
printing some bs from an unsourced us hating conspiracy nut like yourself does not constitute evidence of anything
the saudis pay for a lot of them
the first one seems to come from the far left wing rag the progressive the article is by thomas nagy
the article is called the secret behind the sanctions how the us intentionally destroyed iraq's water supply
of the three papers that he references i have so far only been able to locate the third
here is the paper in reading it i find nothing to support the allegations
i'm going to continue looking for the other papers to see if they help his case or show it to be politically motivated
certainly the paper shows that the idea that drinking water was the only or main health issue in iraq is a lie
i don't follow any religion microbrain
the russian tanks are in crimea and e ukraine show me the american tanks microbrain
where is your evidence that any of these people are nazis putin troll
here is report including data that puts the lie to all the leftist assertions about sanctions
yeah unlike progressive they actually provide facts and data sorry to bother you with them
suicide attack near iraq border kills saudi guards via
saudi general killed on northern border in what appears to be attack
apparently isis has decided to start attacking the saudi border from anbar iraq this will no doubt turn up saudi's war against them
here is the scumbag explaining that we are the problem after telling us we must accept being extorted by muslims
an unbelievable degree of delusion on display in press kvetches a
this is
this is
no you are a liar they are not neo nazi groups idiot that is pure propaganda from the putin media
this man is a liar you can find youtube interviews with the leaders of all ukraine's groups none are neo nazi
mike prysner is some putin paid russian troll working in a propaganda sweat shop in st petersburg
go to wiki putin troll and you will find that half the world's neo nazis live in russia
all of the believers in state fascism between russia and ukraine live in russia
there is no bigger nazi in the region than mike prysner's boss putin
they mean nothing idiot stephan bandera was never a nazi even though he fought with them to rid ukraine of soviets
and you can collect ten times as many nazi pictures in russia
even right sector interviews are on youtube they all reject authoritarian governments and they all have jewish members
and this shows how liars like you try to photoshop pictures for your propaganda
again this putin paid propaganda troll lies right wing parties received less votes in the last ukrainian elections
i see that you are a big user of photoshopped images to sell your propaganda putin troll
why not complete the job at baiji and ramadi and hit and tikrit and let the kurds clean up the north
it's a joke they can't even afford to pay their fighters and they don't have close to that kind of budget
this is what you should learn about and
islam begone
here is what thinks about merkel's democracy
richard ii is nobody's prophet microbrain and you can't excuse the crimes of islam using others crimes
there is a complete failure in your math independent this is islamophobia
and this is what the hate about islam
the prophet mohammed owned black slaves and he called blacks raisin heads
the victims of islam +
let's see why would there be a movement against islam but not against any other religion
what is sharia law here are some of its rules
yeah we hate this kind of islamophobia
muslims arrested in horrific week long repeated gang rape
pc 'logic' and islam's free pass
you are lying he did no such thing
where will they kidnap the teachers from
dead bodies belonging to were found near al-aqtan no more details are available yet about the
tripple price no customers
it probably is silly but i doubt that the who has the resources in mosul to know
here is the information showing mohammed's declaration of war on humanity
how do crimes of christianity excuse the barbarity of islam no one here is trying to sell christianity
handful my ass
if your argument is that islam is not barbaric then make it otherwise you have no case
your contention that we can't say anything about islam because there has been other evil is utterly dumb
you are an ass kissing pandered who thinks political correctness is committing cultural suicide
we have proven to you again and again and you just repeat the same lie no time blocked
we wish it were only a few
it made itself popular at the point of a sword and gun
you are lying
the word islam translates as submission please don't bring us lies
show me where a muslim scholar says i'm wrong here is one
go and read the pact of umar that relegates them to third class citizenship
some jews and christians were allowed third class citizen status
people not of the book like ezidis hindus were slaughtered outright
racism in islam
i can if the religion encourages those actions
if muslims were in per it would be the same abuse of hindus that it was before
and it only took him a year to read it
isis behead street magician for entertaining crowds in syria with his tricks - which were 'an insult to islam'
us and partner nations conducted eight airstrikes near in last hours destroying fighting
you loose count after your fingers and toes try again
here are some of the elements of sharia law
islam is racist
yeah we shouldn't worry about this stuff
or this stuff
or this stuff
or this stuff
no that is simply an islam snow job here is the truth
nothing new look new isis converts today more brutal recent converts islam are more dangerous than older one's
roflmao
mass grave containing bodies of christians found in mosul - mcn
where is muslim condemnation of atrocities silence is deafening
instead of personal attacks maybe you can explain why there are more than islamic terrorist groups
why have there been more than islamic terrorist attacks around the world since
on and indoctrination' by peter townsend today free copy get yours now
take me off your list
take me off your list scum bag
that was your last chance scumbag now you are blocked
if freedom of expression undermines peace we should give up freedom
peace is important but freedom is even more important
remember the spot where cantlie stood in kobane to announce that isis had full control it's now in the hands of the kurds
how is that related to islam
so will the french terrorists be heading to turkey where erdogan can protect them and send them safely to isis
disagree with are you blind to the physical dimension
apparently you are living under a rock it chased them out of france for ten centuries
how is that relevant
neither does pacifism against violence
if you don't have an answer you are just being a sanctimonious complainer
no you are dead wrong
and these
so you admit you were wrong about muslim extremists
sharia law
so you think i have a right to murder anyone who offends me are you living in an asylum because if you aren't you should be
you lost the debate when you changed the subject which was immediately
and the dress is only symbolic of the broader sexism
that's like saying that if i hate naziism it is my mental problem complete nonsense statement
i urge the modi government to show some moral courage and lift the ban on the satanic verses
the only way global media can pay respect to martyrs is by reprinting and republishing them again amp again amp agai
before cnn refrained from showing the charlie hedbo cartoons one host proved he was unafraid http
i agree w goldberg every publishing giant should publish charles hedbo cartoons on the front page for the next seven days w
here are the charlie hedbo cartoons that people died for today view and share them
pretty close to all
mass graves with bodies discovered near iraq's northern city of mosul
daily check on thread daesh surrounded on radio hill shaytat tribe steps up attacks on daesh killing many dae
where did he say that
this is not about war between countries this is about muslims starting wars with unbelievers
wrong the quran is not a history book it is a set of instructions how it got to be instructions is irrelevant
what is inaccurate about the picture maybe you want the basic information
give me verse numbers not your interpretation
no i think the extremism precedes the bombs and what would american bombs have to do with sharia and apostates
because christians expose and stop those things themselves and the cia doesn't claim christianity
and it's not okay to say that only a few are extremists
more like nazi germany not every single german was a nazi
but at that time we didn't have fools saying that we can't fight germany because there are good germans
does talking to a few tell me how many want to kill apostates or implement sharia
why do you say that
by reading the quran and the hadiths
rofl the entire world knows for a fact that the exact opposite is true
muhammad and free speech - an explosive encounter
apparently questioning is not welcome in the middle east
yes that is the verse that insults jews thanks for cherry picking
no you have it backwards it was mohammed murdering jews
next time try the truth instead of taqiyya
he beheaded jewish prisoners and sold their women and children into slavery
here is a great example of mohammed's respect for women so go tell your lies elsewhere
there are multiple hadiths like this that cover it
the leader of those terrorists has a phd in islam it is you that are purposely trying to mislead western audiences
roflmao
they are world famous and deserve it
the kurdish women break every sexist law of islam and are loved by the world half of isis is about repressing women and they are hated
what does that have to do with the barbarity of islam
for what it's worth i don't believe that isis has to terrorists in mosul their inability to reinforce elsewhere says not
why are you distributing and repeating their propaganda
not to mention universities shut down christians chased out women forced to cover and stay home doctors killed
i would rather not be involved in a christianity vs islam debate
you can apply the same standard to the quran
you believe in jinn ridiculous
has begun digging trenches around in fear of an aggressive assault by forces on its stronghold
'no compulsion in religion' qu'ran think again
so there is the occasional muslim that does't do what the quran says so what
rip to the kurdish martyrs on the gwer frontline fighting for humanity and freedom
need better on ground intel stuff like shouldn't happen isis should have been attacked by air before they got there
i'm not sure if i believe that baghdadi was there lily he's been getting bad publicity for hiding like a rat
so let's get after the isis fan boys about him running away and see what happens
so i hear that baghdadi ran like a scared rabbit in gwer guess he has no faith in allah
your caliph ran from battle at gwer like the pussy he is he can't possible have faith in allah and be such a coward
oh good then we can include them in the targeted air strikes
baghdadi ran like a chicken in gwer
i don't have a religion microbrain have you found what hole that coward baghdadi crawled into at gwer
but he's the caliph representative of allah for all muslims how can he run and hide like that
so when some isis ran away at sinjar baghdadi beheaded them but now he ran away at gwer
so will baghdadi do the right thing and behead himself or is he a hypocritical coward
they should have killed the guy just like isis would have done in a similar situation
hey i try
unarmed women and children is the only thing that isis is good at handling
mr abu bakr al-baghdadi gallops away from letting others die for him dawla dawlah http
update - resist heavy weapon attack amp within sight of city's eastern limit ht
watch islam satire and death on youtube -
this is islamophobia
in islam there's a concept called taqiyya which dictates that lying is acceptable if it advances the cause of allah http
liar men and women are segregated in mosques
lol it's far worse than that

you need this to go with it
no compulsion in religion unless you're a child of course
maybe instead of telling me what to do you try this - kiss my ass
wow must be or of them

the pkk haven't been communist for a long time microbrain
that is a lie the prophet mohammed had people executed for criticizing him
islam is not a race microbrain
yahya is ignorant we know exactly how cells make organs and we are on the verge of being able to reproduce the process
the media run their mouths about islam without a single one ever having read the quran or hadiths
salon proves that if you are too stupid to discuss a subject just call people racists they now claim islam is a race
dismissing the pew poll because people may not be answering correctly is replacing data with imagination to suit yourself
that actions of a few line was already stupid terrorist attacks ago
you must be one of those nuts who thinks the crimes of christianity justify the crimes of islam
here are a whole bunch of your little fuckers
what modern moderates
i think you live in a loony bin and get your info off the walls
try reality teacher
i've seen the department of justice crime report and it verifies what i'm saying
you check justice depatment later
for example should i tolerate people who kill people for leaving their religion
i don't have a religion so go fuck yourself racists like you hold humanity back
you are too far off the deep end good night
she's crying because the christians fought back in car

if i had a reason to doubt the holocaust i would regardless of the laws you can be a holocaust denier in america
i have no issues with hindus in fact i rather like the upanishads
the brutality of the old testament is not an excuse for the brutality of islam
i've lived years and have never seen a kkk member the ratio of jihadi attacks to kkk attacks is to
no they don't target children to be killed the palestinians target children to be killed
the holocaust should not be excluded from freedom of speech and neither should mohammed
that is simply a lie
just as i thought there is no evidence of intentionally targeting children and it's not even certain it was an israeli boat
no ice or refrigeration meat going bad looks medieval
oh yeah a few frikin fish and they are ready to rule the world rofl
yeap mosul is a city full of sick people and they have murdered half the doctors
and they think that they can turn some of their illiterates into doctors in three years lol
ongoing daily gruesome murders by isis in mosul and isis has zero to do with providing any of the services
heartbreaking images stoning woman acused of adultery till death in north of

why should they apologize for telling the truth microbrain
who cares who said it it is true
go ahead and remain a moron makes no difference to me
no you are the liar and fox is telling the truth there are mountains of evidence
chat now they are waiting for you
no that is what you and islam do
the caved to the pressure to be pc
so what are you claiming microbrain
you are a left wing asshole who thinks that everyone should defend their culture except whites
no i don't just because some tv crew went in unharmed it proves nothing
here look at the statistics for what muslims believe
if any white christians polled those opinions you would be going ballistic about it
but it doesn't matter what muslims believe or do it's all okay because they are not white christian
so all you left wing assholes are doing is flaunting your racism
but you don't have the same attitude about turning everyone against christians do you
do assholes like you post this stuff because you respect some christians
you are the white christian hating bigot i'm opposed to this
countries like saudi and iran have religious police to impose such
muslims have blasphemy laws to impose such
your bigotry makes you attack people who are fighting against this
yeah women don't care about life just kill the little bastards
but you attack a conservative news source if they object to the same things you do
if you want to call out right wingers then do it over substance not a knee jerk reaction of taking sides
showing your stupidity again i don't follow any religion
you are the hate monger murdering babies i'm defending them
no i don't their treatment by left wingers is just a perfect example of lw hypocrisy
my guess is that you have never read the quran or hadith and are just spouting the lw line
i don't have to remind myself lw trolls remind me of their hypocrisy every day
and now we have reached the predictable ending of discussion with lw personal attack
how about this one
and yet you attack the people who attack an ideology with positions you pretend to hate
all of which makes you a hypocrite with no ideology beyond us versus them
here is sexism in islam
yeah i love idiots like you who tell me that i have to tolerate the intolerant you can stick that
no people who want to kill apostates support jihad support sexism support sharia are not people they are scum
and of course i would also fight against any theocracy - regardless of religion
at last we have a point of complete agreement
half the mosques that are built in west are financed and staffed by gulf states looking for salafism
which is why we want secular societies to protect women against that
no religion is organized worship and control of people spirituality is a subjective experience between one person and god
i'm against any jew or christian that wants to live by old testament law as opposed to secular law
almost all jews are secular and could care less about following the example of moses
haven't seen a kkk member in my entire life muslim attacks to kkk attacks are ten thousand to one
no the bible is man made garbage will you say the same about the quran
one of the stupidest lines that muslims try is to excuse their barbarity by christian barbarity
so your attitude is to let minorities in the me suffer under sharia
big dif between not eating pork and stoning people one involves others one does not
but you keep returning to the stupid idea that christian barbarity justifies muslim barbarity
it's not a race to the bottom compare islam to secular humanism
you seem to be rambling without a point
what double standard microbrain i'm not a jew or a christian
i think that number of muslims that believe barbaric ideas is over the top
but what if of atheists supported the totalitarianism of the ussr
christians and yezidis in iraq thought their muslim neighbors were fine until isis came along
yeah look what corporate media did
i saw armstrong tell five lies in two sentences in that article no point in reading more lies beyond that
german anti-islam group vows that it won't be silenced
who cares what some idiot said
so you are not insulted when the prophet calls women stupid
you are a liar
changed or unchanged stupidity is still stupidity
yeah it says that men can beat women so what is your point
more sexism keep women chaste but let men have four wives and sex slaves
isis execute football fans by firing squad for watching iraq play jordan on tv in mosul
the story comes from raqqa rt living in raqqa and he gets them right about of the time
here it is from the new york post
executed christian pastor murtaza ablahad years old in mosul today isis had demanded ransom from his http
a village of called memata cleansed from isis and liberated by kurdish forces
no they are not really communists any more
their position now is democratic confederalism
little do they know that they are no permanent prisoners of the daesh
so why not start a company that does not make a profit average corporate profitability is
but if someone wants to create companies that have zero profit no one will stop them
and while everyone talks about corporate greed no one steps up to create altruistic companies
of course there are countries where there are no greedy corporations and no private banks like north korea

charlie hebdo attacks prove critics were right about islam via
isis executing 'educated professional women'
the difference between crime and punishment by isis and by saudi arabia
or they bought it from hobby lobby and can't figure out how it goes together lol
the daesh are doing a great job of producing hell on earth for the people living in their areas
soon the people of raqqa and mosul will not fear going to hell because they are already there
is there any difference between regime amp daesh
roflmao
what data i didn't see a single item of data - only one guy's conclusions
good that trash should be mocked by the world
emirs are among the isis fighters killed in the last two days in clashes near mosul dam and dijila http

i think the pesh just want to isolate mosul for right now
what i gave you is the historical research ever hear of it or do you just limit yourself to invented superstition
there zero independent historical research that backs up anything in the quran or hadiths

mosul is an arab snake pit where they sell yezidi slaves expelled kurds and christians are we suppose to feel sorry for them
pvt jets bring guests to davos to talk global warming ahhhhh the sweet smell of hypocrisy http
i'm not sure why we care about any of the waring sides in yemen it's not like anyone is fighting for democracy or freedom
even ezidi press has never made such a claim clearly the slave sales were held in mosul after kurds were gone
and yezidis are fighting side by side with kurds not with any sunni arabs
as soon as isis chased all the minorities out of mosul the sunni arabs were happy to steal their property so fuck them
isis commander abu aisha killed by sniper in tilkef christian city today http
you'r liar you lived with them as dhimmis - third class citizens with no legal right and they were all exterminated in saudi
these are the animals you want us to feel sorry for
i'm surprised that they still have any tanks left
good vid when we advanced they left weapons and ran
turkey keeps giving weapons to the terrorists in syria
what i find surprising is that when the daesh decide to stone some poor woman to death they actually find civilian volunteers that do it
how can you not side with kurdish fighters that always smile and that regularly circle up hold hands sing and dance
kobane situation map jan edt major gains in e and w http
the government is not the us americans hate the saudi monarchy
to isis the japanese are just kafirs like everyone else that is not a sunni muslim
isis loves killing women and children so what is your objection exactly what was isis doing when they shelled kobane
so do you think that the daesh are planning the second battle of the trench to be in mosul instead of medina
it's only an issue among the hopelessly politically correct self guilt trippers the people who want to keep us from ever winning
sources in mosul while isis terrorists were preparing a tanker of chlorine gas to attack peshmerga its destroyed by rocket
isn't it ironic that people who butcher and enslave everyone want to talk about women and children
rofl good the more huge the isis attack the more dead daesh there will be to fertilize the land
and this sums up islam
rofl that's an warthog hit by a sam in it made it home safely you guys are really desperate
sources civilians in mosul wants to leave city but roads blockaded by jihadis to use them as human shield for defence
sources tribes in mosul wants isis to leave the city as then clashes erupt amp there are hundreds of is member killed amp ask fo
the ypg evacuated civilians of kobane when isis attacked but isis won't let mosul civilians leave so they can hide behind em
sources isis terrorists hunting turkmens in city of mosul to claim that peshmerga did it later on and serve on media
the fact that isis were killed in by a chlorine depot explosion is what you call kar
the best statement i`ve seen about the west needs wake-up and fully support the
help from raqqa to mosul will have to go the long way around and won't be able to reinforce kobane
you will never get into afrin microbrain the chlorine gas was yours
are you hoping for a lot of dead civilians to serve your propaganda goals
ypg has civilians leave before the fight the daesh holds them prisoner and uses them as shields
look up the word taqiyya
turkey gave that gas they used to blame syria and now they use chlorine depots of sad
that many daesh and more are being killed every single day
choudary is a coward that sends kids to be killed fighting for isis but he makes up lame excuses for not going himself
if that is true why are you not joining isis coward
this hypocritical coward will not put his action behind his words by joining isis
hamas admits that they did use children as human shields is anyone paying attention http
islam is not a religion this is what an honest ex-muslim woman victim of islam says
here is what winston churchill said about islam
that is one of the reasons why south korea is doing so well and why all muslim countries are impoverished authoritarian sewers
lies and propaganda this is raqqa
not punishment sick and gruesome behavior are you going to punish the isis animals that mortared civilians in kobane
what about the daesh that murdered thousands of unarmed ezidi civilians what is their punishment you are just a criminal
your demand for perfection would lead to those kids living under isis and brought up as terrorists
we have seen the mercy of islam with million citizens of the earth murdered
again you are lying the mass graves are being uncovered as the kurds take back their land from the daesh animals
this is life in the khalifa an orgy of murder and celebration of killing in the most gruesome way
there are a few kurds who betrayed their people and joined the daesh criminals and a few stayed and live in fear
you spend your time sitting on the kuffir's internet trying to convince idiots like yourself to join your daesh animals
then when the idiots arrive in raqqa they discover the blackness depression and misery of living under the daesh
media lies what media lies tell me there is not a place with human heads on a stake and that women are not forced home
it's used because the uranium allows the mm rounds to penetrate tank armor so give them another material that will do the same
of all human inventions and science happened in the last years virtually nothing from muslims
jews are represented among nobel prize winners by ratio of to over muslims jews contribute positive muslims negative
there are literally millions of inventions your list is like nothing and all of it would have been invented by someone else
salahuddin was a kurd and decent general - just fighting for a bad cause
that jews are controlling the world is one of those idiotic conspiracy theories muslims use to hide their failure
same applies to most asians they work hard study hard and get the results mohammed was a caravan robber too lazy to work
what they have is much closer to democracy than what isis has kurds rescued minorities isis murdered them
honor for kurdish women fighting thugs in the north
breaking has been liberated fully retweet to honour those who saved the city with their lives http
woohoo breaking has been liberated fully retweet to honour those who saved the city with their lives
wish i had means to throw a party for all the ypg ypj since i don't i give all a hardy virtual handshake
more on the gas cloud over that caused locals to panic mosul eye blogger says it was bomb gone wrong
breaking eshmarga commander confirmed they killed more than isis militants in both bashik and mawaran fronts northe
rofl where is kobani in the picture answer - they have lost it
you prophet used catapults on cities killing women and children the coward
with that kind of lack of reality contact i can now see why you joined isis
the cowards are the ones hiding behind the civilians in mosul instead of going to meet the pesh that are right there
since both the daesh and your prophet murdered women and children you are talking like a hypocrite
if you never loose the world would already belong to islam instead only poverty backwardness and violence belong to islam
and like russian militants is beheaded captured peshmerga pow in mosul
the toxic gasses belonged to isis
there was no random bombardment with chemical weapons the isis chemical weapons were blown up
you are obviously an imposter making up lies for the daesh
i already have multiple times
there were no chemical missles fired the pesh hit isis chemical weapons with their rockets
executed adnan abdulrazaq a cameraman for al-sama tv today in

sorry islamic taquiyya will not work on me
yesterday a daesh fan posted a pic of an with one engine blown off claimed daesh did it i found the pic it from
western feminists give a free pass on sexism to everyone but white western conservative males
nope there will be no long term war the caliphate of the rat in hiding will be dead before the end of this year
how about this guy
so i'm thinking daesh no longer have the resources to launch a successful major attack anywhere what do you think
sick satanic henchmen of the iranian regime executed a disabled man he was disabled due to torture in prison http
kurds were supposed to be in ummah at the beginning oh amp i see now in isis statement it is actually arab nationalism http
syrian planes attacking kobane or efrin would be shot down by coalition i guarantee it
who needs a propaganda war when you morons publish this shit
they are not just trying they are succeeding you lost kobane pesh are knocking on mosul door
i think that your masters are telling you stuff to jack up moral and they will try something - but it will fail you'll see
gwer is a good example daesh had a good plan of attack but not the manpower to make it stick so they lost resources
i'm thinking that daesh have no choice but to try to take back the intersection of hw and hw near tal afar
they need to try to reconnect raqqa sinjar tal afar and mosul but they will fail because of not enough men
mop up
between and would be my guess
i count reports of daesh deaths around syria and iraq and adjusting for exaggeration daesh are loosing more that a day
so they are loosing more than per year the peshmerga guess was an overestimate and included future draft from mosul
loss of kobane sinjar corpses returning home will dry up recruiting and europe just doesn't have that many crazy people
that's probably because we defeated hitler the japanese empire the chinese in korea and we fight for freedom and democracy
why would i let you bait me into that lol easier to kill daesh with zero loses your price for being primitive
you seem to have a small vocabulary but being stupid and being muslim go together
you could repeat that but your job is getting recruits so it has no meaning
no microbrain the pesh are not using chemical weapons
and the silence from the pc feminist left is deafening
are you just whining or do you have a solution
so what is your solution buckey just let isis take over the world or do you just like being sanctimonious
fighters and have pushed militants out of the autonomous canton of reports
nice artistic conceptualization
won against and their partner
lol making excuses for attacking the kurds i see but everything isis holds was stolen including raqqa
more stolen childhoods
regardless they attacked the kurds because they wanted their land all the rest is excuses
the important thing is that the people of kobane are alive and free and they will rebuild the city
but the daesh are now moving backwards no one is afraid of them any more
when daesh made children into killers committing genocide against minorities and slavery they wrote their own obituary
one way to keep the front lines away from the raqqa civilians was not to invade raqqa
but abu bakr baghdadi promised me he told me god is with us
are these the arab citizens that cheered and joined isis when they were exterminating ezidis
bs story others claim it was ezidis
isis was attacking the ezidis and peshmerga from those villages blame isis for the deaths
after their genocide murder rape and slavery the daesh now expect sympathy from the world no way
that is an awesome rifle and it costs a ton i'd love to have one make sure they don't end in isis hands
i'll have to settle for the winchester mag i'm building
and western feminists are silent
wouldn't you rather be one of these
show me an isis flag flying in kobane in the last hours norway girl one with the camera's date stamp on it please
interesting description of heaven not much mention of what the women get norway girl
was watching a clip of pesh fighting daesh near mosul today pesh using daesh for target practice
that is a lie one crate out of went to isis
erdogan's target is to oust assad and replace him with even worse islamolunatics
year old jewish boy attacked in paris suburb via
taqiyya bs from the islamoliars
siege of radio hill has been broken
better get out of the me norway girl or you won't make it through
such a rational religion
the daesh are so scared and helpless that all they have left is a propaganda campaign of lies
isis burnt down the most ancient church in mosul
isis orders genital mutilation of women and girls in mosul iraq
this is a total fraud that only idiots would believe no such license ever existed
no what a moron meaning you no such license ever existed anywhere in the us
this is reality
lol the celebration of victory over daesh in kobane
western media eastern media al jazeera russian media - all said same thing about daesh murdering yezidi
yeah al jazeera is targeting islam and how did daesh get the yezidi slaves
did the western media throw these gays off a building
did the western media put these heads on stakes
is this the western media doing mass beheadings or mass executions
beautiful map chuck
shame on zuckerberg
yeah and i'm waiting for santa clause
kim jong un embraces islam
yeah i noticed
submission
get a psychiatrist
ghandi is dead wrong real history shows that islam was unquestionably spread by the sword
when was the last time you were in rome
gee i'll loose a lot of sleep over that
no idiot i have read the entire quran and many of the hadiths
here is bigotry
yeah you should try the understanding part some time
morons like you use gellar because you can't deal with a real debate on islam
i've chatted with muslims for years they don't know their religion or lie
you are a scum bag making accusations that you cannot verify
satan is a fairy tale used to scare idiots into submission
my understanding of english is perfect microbrain
you are just blabbering nonsense like any cult follower
you lying pos they lived as third class citizens with no legal rights
just leaders that extorted them with jizya read code of umar microbrain
not really the radicals follow the religion to the letter
the bloodiest history of murder is that of islam
he married aisha at and screwed her at he was that is the definition of a pedophile
conspiracy garbage
no it's not it's hard to understand how muslims could believe so many lies
snooor
mohammed had no excuse at all to attack khybar jews
mohammed led major military expeditions most were offemsive
no we give women the same freedom as men
have you noticed how isis prices women in the slave market
the stupidity of muslims is to blame their failures
hello microbrain look at the research polls
another conspiracy theory idiot with no data
one of the reasons why the daesh will be destroyed is their display of joy in murder and cruelty
you are lying the quran is stuffed with invocations to murder non believers
i know exactly the truth of islam apparently you don't
another stupid excuse isis is islam not cia or mossad
lol mccain thought he was talking to moderate fsa people he had no way of vetting the people in the room
also the picture of the guy behind baghdadi is a photoshop image
peshmerga hitting isis on major offensive to reach mosul goo via
daesh keep trying attacks and they all fail this indicates that they are suffering a big manpower shortage
i don't have a problem with a one for one exchange
let's have a protest march against hamas
and the same god promised the muslims the entire earth
who cares what ships are in the gulf
and why do we care about this guy
i see your pics tell us what you think they mean nothing
again here is what islam stole m
if they did they would post immediate propaganda video of it if there is no video it didn't happen
roflmao where is the video of all the captured ypg women
and the residents of kobane stood in turkey cheering every bomb that was dropped on daesh
report from pesh near mosul it's a turkey shoot
turkish dep pm says 'we hope they will not forget the role we played in kobane don't worry we won't
where are the buildings
not if they claim to be in kirkuk
how pitiful after murdering civilians everywhere the daesh try to use civilians for propaganda the cowards
peshmerge forces took over the village of salihiya -km north of tal afar biji peshmerge dast xosh peshmerge
after murdering shia yezidi kurd and christian children daesh try to use children for propaganda sickening
so the picture could be from anywhere in the countryside and cannot be confirmed to be from kirkuk
other than a few pictures of gruesome executions daesh have no evidence of any success any more
in the meantime the peshmerga are posting pictures of truckloads of daesh killed in battle
but it's hard to call it battle since the pesh are killing daesh like a hunter shooting turkeys
daesh are now left with nothing but to hide behind civilians and then cry about how civilians are getting killed
unfortunately three tyrants assad erdogan and khamenie stand in the way of kurdish statehood
fighter and his daughter on mt we fight for what we love while our enemies fight because they hate http
never forget the worst crimes against humanity in solidarity with the people
a -years old girl died after raped mutlipe times by isis terrorist in ministry of human rights repor
here you go daesh cunt
true about rt however there are islamic organizations in us that could
the history i claim are historical facts what is there to purify
and where you are a prisoner that is not allowed to leave
this video of the peshmerga decimating isis is far more interesting
there was no former glory just a backward state powered by war and slaves
they are so happy about it look at all the smiles lol
video kurdish peshmerga fighters engaging isis in mosul iraq the way isis fighters run is jokes
you are on the wrong path the pkk and ypg are not communist
obviously this and that without a shred of evidence for any of it this is just meat for conspiracy theory lunatics
on daesh 'we've been surprised in some instances daesh fighters flee they don't fight daesh morale is on the decline
i've seen a couple of daesh videos lately and they confirm what you say
looks like things have turned around and the daesh are now very quick to run away
things have changed now the daesh behave like the iraqi army did before they run at every encounter with the peshmerga
amen stand your ground- gt gun range's ban on draws fire
i noticed that all the daesh are running away from the peshmerga you can witness it in pesh videos
hey i can't help it if the world is anxious to get in on the action against the daesh apes and swine
so the americans boots are right there defending the air bases where are the daesh goat fuckers
wake up microbrain us boots are on the ground in israq but the daesh chickens won't fight them
lol pesh have video of daesh running like frightened rats
good idea your prophet mohammed said camel urine is great medicine try some
germany authorizes controversial military aid to kurds
no the chlorine gas that blew up belonged to the daesh microbrain they are trying to manufacture it
actually they are out of kobane and they are shrinking stop embarrassing yourself and research
lol a couple of month ago the story was that daesh were i pervious to air strikes
and ignorant uneducated social rejects are all that daesh can attract
that is why the us can kill thousands of the worthless daesh without loosing a man
with baghdadi bad mouthing mullah omar that will be the end of that
maybe you didn't notice that was an august article microbrain now daesh are sending children to fight for them
regardless of who thinks what there is only one definition of the religion
were any of them successful
peshmerga and anti-terror squad retook areas south of kirkuk seized by isis last night peshmerga forces repelled http
daesh complain about children killed with daesh chlorine gas that's rich and daesh recruite children and send them to die
thanks i'm glad that all the genocidal daesh slavers were cleared out
peshmerga killed during last night clashes with isis in battle fronts inc kirkuk mosul and makhmour and tens of isi
there is no such thing as the devil and ezidis are not devil worshipers that is pure islamolunatic propaganda
on top of that why are the supposed devil worshipers living peacefully while the allah worshipers act like the devil
and the ypg ypj only kill daesh in combat
islamic terrorist groups have nothing to do with us they have existed forever
and like boko haram and many others they only need the concept of islamic jihad
war with japan didn't produce buddhist terrorist groups stop the excuses
justice loving islam stole all in green through war
there is no ongoing endless occupation anywhere
all those things can be found in islam's own quran and hadiths
if i were blinded by hatred i would feel same about buddhism hinduism tao etc you are blinded by stupidity
pres barack ' speak for no religion' not quite
here is a philosophical exercise for you the quran repeatedly tells you to fear allah now why would god want to be feared
escaped syrian child soldier 'don't join '
the quran specifically says to fear allah god would not want to be feared and god would not want control based on fear
so the writer of the quran modeled god on earthly tyrants because that was his image of an authority figure
spirituality is the quest to join with god in a subjective union that has nothing to do with following rules
spirituality is a connection with god that is direct and includes no prophets or imams
spirituality is the common divinity of all things all things being a manifestation of god
spirituality does not see man and god as separate entities it sees all existence as a continuous process of creation
some sufis tried to inject spirituality into islam after mohammed but they mostly failed there is in sunni or shia islam none
if you never compare islam with a close study of spiritual philosophies you won't know what i'm talking about
but spirituality is not ritual or rules or groveling prayer it is a private subjective experience
the japanese army was a nationalist group not a religious terror group
segregation of the sexes is just one more of the backwards steps that islam hopes to achieve
what do radical islamic terrorists have to do to get the attention of obama
a i don't have a faith b your tweet is incoherent
i don't believe in religion but i don't care if others do as long as they
i've seen it gandhi was wrong all historical evidence is against him
i don't care how elevated gandhi was he was wrong about islam in fact he may have been outright lying about it
but he lied to achieve that peace and anything built on a lie will eventually fail
massive attacks sign of weakness not strength
isis breaks into mosul library and steals thousands of books
capture oil field workers in pass them off as lost almost fighters
muslim had burned the great library alexandria and now this iraqi libraries ransacked by islamic state in mosul http
gandhi and shaw are dead so you can't ask them about the stupidity of statements
but if you think such things are meaningful here
i don't care about stupid opinions i care about quran
i have no problem with semites only with islam
throws another person accused of sodomy off a building this time in ht
are you fighting the daesh or is your position to let them take over or maybe you just like ranting sanctimoniously
so basically you are a coward who attacks other people claiming they are cowards cause i don't see you doing squat
you mean many ignorant and uneducated cultures
that is why the jewish state looks like this
fine by me i had five jewish friends in college none ever went to a synogogue
no they haven't
three jewish tribes lived in medina before mohammed moved there and attacked them
i don't say it islam's own hadiths say it
i told her that whatever the plan it would fail because isis no longer had the manpower to make attacks work
all states were established through war
there were no traitors in khybar and not accepting islam is not being a traitor
because of arabian penninsula was jewish before mohammed's exterminations
and the penninsula was filled with christians as well
who is you what is an illegal settlement all muslim settlements were made by violence
you don't know your jewish tribes jews of khybar had nothing to do with a treaty against the meccans
the jews of khybar lived in khybar far from medina
and the jews of medina only agreed to a treaty with mohammed because he had already ejected two other jewish tribes
rofl sorry i don't have time for crazy people blocked
the dignity of that peshmerga as he faced death was remarkably heroic
roflmao
i hate these empty gestures as us president he must do more
dozens of vehicles belonging to were destroyed by coalition airstrikes from the border en route
sunni turkmen there overwhemingly supported isis and hopefully every single one that did so will flee with them to raqqa
ypg give their own positions coalition would not bomb contradictory reports microbrain
in addition an updated pass code would be used
yawn
why cry when you daesh scum send year olds to war to die for baghdadi
we will kill daesh in our rage not die in it
looks like the kurdish girls are going to chase the daesh all the way to raqqa
so go and fight isis yourself instead of being a babbling internet coward what is stopping you
no you should go to iraq and fight isis but you are a sanctimonious coward afraid to do what you tell others to do
and i'm calling you out for not doing what you tell others to do microbrain now get your ass to iraq and start fighting daesh
militants have removed a church cross in tel hormizd in hassakah and kidnapped three assyrian men locals http
so get your fat ass off the couch and go and fight isis what is your problem are your legs broken or are you a
either you go and fight isis or you approve of their rape murder and genocide or you are a coward and a blowhard which is it
so you claim that they don't need to be fought that makes you the same kind of sick inhuman disgusting animal as they
how would you know you would'nt recognize logic if it fell on you only a total idiot would support one sided pacificim
how do assad and boko justify isis more idiots logic
only a total moron would take the position that's if you can't fight every injustice you shouldn't fight any injustice
did you get that brain out of a box of cracker jacks
with the lack of any logic at all you are not equipped with the problem of tying your own shoes
you would claim there is no point in tying your shoes when your shirt is not buttoned
you have been completely defeated and you are just too dumb to know it
okay i'll give you a chance to state what you believe for yourself instead of launching your brain dead attack on others
roflmao so all this time i've been trying to squeeze logic out of a religious nut that is as crazy as isis
i knew that when you were pressed you would fall apart like humpty dumpty and you want to attack greta you are a joke blocked
flash isis used chemical gas loaded suicide car bomb in mosul against peshmerga http
isis is now using chlorine gas against the peshmerga we knew the gas that blew up in mosul was theirs all along
isis is now using chlorine gas suicide bombs against peshmerga we knew all along that what blew up in mosul was theirs
troops liberate workers sputnik international
kirkuk is the new kobane from usaf point of view a lot of targets in contact with friendly forces servin
utterly insane article
more news about ' desperate rule men refusing to join its ranks face the death penalty http
another stupid move by isis this will bring japanese into the action to help kill daesh daesh brains are fried by islam
yeap half your best fighters died in kobane you are down to sending children to fight and die for baghdadi
lol when the coalition entered you tried to convince the world that they didn't effect you make up your mind
now each offensive the daesh try to mount looks weaker and more pitiful than the last
the moron baghdadi thinks he can throw undermanned forces out there on offensives and allah will win it for him
we only need to count the daesh corpses every day
and loosing kobane probably lost you foreign recruits
that's a lie the only thing you milked was bombs and all you gained was dead daesh
and the kurds success makes others feel like they can do the same
no it's winding down the children the daesh are forced to send just can't fight
exactly the kobane citizens stood on turkish hills and cheered with every bomb that fell
it must be obvious to even you that daesh are spread too thin to win a fight on their many fronts
a our fight is defensive b we only do that in war context they do it everywhere but i still agree to a degree

first mohammed ejected two tribes of jews from medina and stole their property
before mohammed the jews lived on of the arabian peninsula almost all that land has been stolen by musli
the jews that did live under muslims lived as dhimmis according to pact of umar so they had no legal rights
the result was the complete extermination of jews and christians in many parts of muslim world
furthermore the hatred against jews christians and any non believers is engraved in the quran and hadith
i'm sure all the christians in mosul agree with you wait they were all killed or driven out
something is changing in mosul kurdistan flag raised over buildings by unknown protesters

a failed state is one where people cannot take care of themselves and must be taken care of by the state

isis seems to look for ever more gruesome ways to murder people jordanian pilot burned alive
jordanian pilot moaz al-kasasbeh was burned alive in a cage
burned alive on jan rd means that daesh didn't have pilot to trade with the jordanians as they claimed
its clear from islamic state video that the jordanian pilot muath kasasbeh was badly tortured before being burned alive c

i have to think that jordan and especially it's pilots are raging to get revenge

okay muslim taqiyya liar you have one more tweet to show where the quran limits marriage age if not you are blocked
i'd be happy to debate the lies this islamist pos tells in his article bring him here
it's total bs i've seen the attempts to derive ashia's age using other events that effort produces about five different ages
the fact that it produces many broadly different ages proves that the derivation method is wrong
and the fact that many different hadiths say she was six when they married is not contradicted directly by anything
many in mosul supported the isis take over before they discovered the truth about mosul
and they did it without saddam's son torturing them when they lost
you know that leipert is a liar because he hides the fact that hadiths say that aisha was when married to mo
she was married at six and he had sex with her at

why do i have to read arabic heard of translations

give me evidence that he get's a penny from cia you sound a nutty as erdogan
blah blah and still no evidence of a gulen crime erdogan's crimes are on youtube
all those tweets and not a shred of evidence blocked
i come from reality
there is no interpretation to i was six years old only taquiyya muslims trying to lie about it
those coming from one source are not classified as sound so you are again a liar
we don't agree the hadiths are classified as sound by hadiths writers they are not classified as weak
your claim about one source is your claim and is a lie otherwise the hadiths would not have been classified as sound
she says in seven different hadith that she was married at and raped at she says it directly and clearly
kybar was attacked by mohammed the whole excuse for the attack is a fabrication for which no evidence exists
who was there that tells your story where is this provocation documented
here is the story of the ghatafan and mohammed is always attacking and always claiming it is preemptive
today isis follows mohammed's example they produce nothing steal and extort what they have and live by murder and hatred
the information you are bringing is from the hadiths not the quran i don't recall age being discussed in quran
agreed
i have seen that one i'm not sure what it implies i couldn't find any context in verses around it
daesh left to defend turf outside mosul are destined to die in the next few weeks
little by little as the photos come in it shows the arms are getting better and the arms are getting worse

i think the us would love to give heavy weapons to pesh but worry about relationship to iraqi government
probably has to do with the fact that kurds are the only ones in the me not calling for their extermination
merging ruthless shia militia into iraqi military may mean militia taking over the military
we have to stop helping the shia militias fight isis it's evil fighting evil we shouldn't help either
we should refuse to provide weapons to iraq without a guarantee that they will not go to the shia militia animals

do you think the media photoshoped these
apparently you are stupid and have done zero research on the subject
good lord i'm shocked have you even read the quran
so your argument is that islam is good because others did bad things in the past try again
start by reading the historian will durant his book our oriental heritage describes the muslim invasion
of india he calls it the bloodiest chapter in history and he documents all of it
so they are murdering ezidis to resist the us are you insane
all the disinformation comes from daesh we know that there is no problem at al asad
people need to stop with the breaking about al asad the information is already both old and wrong everything is fine at al asad
no they aren't
they kill only the other muslims that oppose them they kill ezidis and christians as non believers
true and there is no real attack just some haphazard ineffective long range shelling it will disappear with the arrival
a it's not breaking it's old b it's not true
nope eight of the little daesh vermin attacked al asad air base and all were quickly killed
there is no sovereignty of dictators only real elections bestow sovereignty
this shows where islam would be if they didn't kill apostates
we neither created or supported sadam we dealt with him cause that was what there was
that's what is called an assertion it is worthless and all the data contradicts it
no they didn't
good the warthogs will have a feast
not breaking not true
base was attacked by daesh in iraqi army uniforms all were killed by iraqi army no one got close to our marines
look if you don't know anything about islam then don't waste my time
we didn't overturn elections in either place the people did and the people have that right as long as they elect new ppl
those lunatics are dying like flies and don't stand even a remote chance
obama is kinder to islam than any other future western leader is likely to be
they just gained that control and they will not have it long
and do the daesh idiots think they can practice genocide and slavery and not provoke anyone
isis has the only institutes in the world designed to make people stupider
do you think of democracy in the hamas sense one man one vote one time
here
you mean popular among dictators
these pictures make me smile
if all the people of mosul support isis why has isis passed a law that people cannot leave the city liar

wikipedia tells us that over half the world's neonazis live in russia
and any fool can read about stephan bandera and find that he had no nazi ideaology
furthermore even the most right wing ukrainian groups are anti authoritarian unlike dictator putin
there are no ukr nazis get an education bandera did not hold a nazi ideaology
and this is about russia the russians are attacking and brutalizing the ukrainians
you haven't met any ukrainians bandera is only popular among some ukrainians
and the reason that he is popular with them is for fighting against the soviet invaders
furthermore the right wing parties only received about of vote they get more in russ amp eu
there is nothing nazi about defending your country against a russian invasion
are you so utterly stupid that you don't see that the russians are in ukraine not the reverse
the russians murdered times as many
no the grads are being fired by the russian terrorists at the civilians for propaganda
there are zero places hit by grads that are not in range of russian grads
the russian supported yanukovich stole billion from ukraine
the yanukovich admin all together stole billion and yanukovich was a putin puppet
the ukrainian economy was raped by the russians so now you talk about your pennies
the ukrainians wanted out from under russian corruption
instead you support putin and his fraudulent elections and state controlled propaganda media
you claim to be a jew but rabbis wrote putin to tell him they suffered no discrimination in uk
i know the economy was in trouble but yanuk made it worse
most of the trouble was from political corruption which is what the ukrainians were protesting
flushing political corruption was the objective to the protests not pro nazism
the entire russian propaganda machinery was used to sell maidan as something it was not
the russian attack on maidan was lie from the beginning
do you actually think that the chechens russia has sent to ukraine are there to fight for freedom
for the ukrainians who bamdera is a hero he only holds that status for fighting the soviets in ukr
and there have been dozens of witnesses who have seen the russians target civilians for propaganda
you guys i'm an american living in colorado
no i wouldn't the right wing guys fought the yanukovich thugs but the aim remained corruption
are you talking about jews they are not leaving western ukraine these days
i'll stick with colorado real estate if you don't mind
some chechens fight for russ because putin bought them few fight for ukr because they hate putin
please don't link me to salon might as well give me putin owned rt directly
so contact some jews in lviv and some in donetsk today and find out who is treated better
and this is one of the russian rebels
and here is an example of russia photoshopping the war with propaganda
university of - muslim student admits she made up the whole story
proves that the entire ukrainian nazi narrative was invented by russian propaganda
better you go to wiki and read all about bandera he held no nazi ideaology
here is how the russian are photoshoping their invasion
beyond that notice that the russian control makes them leave and ukr control makes them return
all i can tell you is that if you really want to understand putin read masha gessen's book
the name of masha gessen's book is the man without a face putin's entire life is about thuggery
you can claim they are ridiculous but you have to back it up read gessen understand putin
article is the same defensive stupidity and same failure to confront the real problem this will assure that such attacks keep up
he will make an inane speech about religious tolerance and avoid facing the problem
this article gives no evidence of bandera in a nazi prison ordering pogroms
and it clearly states that his objective was to create a ukrainian nation not spread nazi ideas
i don't claim he didn't participate in attrocities but much less so than stalin
and stalin is being returned to the status of national hero by both putin and by the ukr rebels
and he seems to think that being a russian speaker means wanting to be part of russia
no part of eastern ukraine is more than ethnic russia and the majority never wanted to join r
seen that crap it's lies for example there were never more than million american imdians
but this is the truth
and yours is so stupid that you are blocked
at least churchill got it right
blocked
rolling in russian tanks and stealing their land is not leaving them alone read masha gessen
i think gessen lives in ny now and she is jewish go talk to here at least
and why do you side with people who admire an even bigger genocidal maniac in stalin
for the millionth time bandera had no nazi ideology neither do svoboda or right sector
obviously you are too dumb to know what was going on in india at the time of that statement
lol islamist propaganda
one religion's barbarity doesn't excuse another religions barbarity
there are both iraqi army australian military there plus attack helicopters and warthogs will cover marines not in danger
a real attack on al asad would yield a daesh killing ground lots of open space and no civilians to hide behind
understand your point seems like i heard of a plan to retake baghdadi today
was a pedophile
what are you talking about
then don't take him as your prophet
and the reason you do that is because you have no principles other than being pc and hating the white race
what you are telling me is to tolerate the intolerant to satisfy your pc guilt and you can stick that advice right up your ass
who cares it's about the example that the religion tries to follow that determines if it can be reformed
now you are just babbling like an incoherent left wing idiot bush didn't kill civilians and bush is not our prophet
there you go ignore reality so that you can keep spouting your left wing dogma and engage in your favorite flavor of hate
rofl where did you get that absurd stat
but by your idiotic logic if we cannot solve all problems we should not try to solve any problems
why can't i pick the worst case and work on it you have zero logic in your argument

in fact raqqa had a reputation in syria as not being very religious
i'm not adverse to putting boots on the ground at raqqa and letting our boys kill isis through a scope sight
but i don't want to randomly bomb the entire place

cut the manufactured shit and answer the question are the daesh libya
why would i care about your insane bs are the daesh libya
so we know that you are lying about egypt attacking libya and the gov of libya appreciates egypt's help
and of course the video doesn't say what you claim so again you prove that you are a liar
everybody hates daesh with a passion and there are a million good reasons for it
just the fact that no one can give reports should tell you everything
guess they are taking revenge for daesh murders

true i think that any other us president would have sent more help earlier
and i don't like the way that obama is ignoring isis in libya
i hope you are not talking about the kurds their aid to minority groups has been incredible
the important part is that they regrouped rearmed and immediately came back
i doubt that you have ever been in a street fire fight it's easy being an armchair hero
i disagree the ypg ypj were most responsible and the air strikes helped
isis mass graves are being uncovered all over ninevah so that harmless characterization is a lie
totally wrong here is what muslims want from their own answers
people have no right not to be insulted by others free speech if they did there would be no free speech

i can
it's quite trivial if you use relative motion the earth does not move under the airplane so that the plane chases locations
the atmosphere moves with the plane if you throw an object straight up it already has radial momentum even though
you didn't give it to the object as a result throwing straight up brings it straight down and the conservation of it's
radial momentum means that it does not fly away in the same way both the plane and the atmosphere have radial momentum
of course momentum can only be linear but the combination of gravity and linear momentum produce radial movement

i've read the entire quran how old are you
the first colonizers or crusaders were muslims who attacked europe years before the christian crusades
tell me how old you are i don't want to be here attacking a child about her religion
of course the muslims were doing the same to each other the question is can civilization move beyond religious barbarism
and the turks were conducting the armenian genocide in the last century again the question is can we get beyond religious hate

come on morons let's all go to the same verses in our own quran start with are you afraid
what does your quran say
do the taliban lock women up at home like tells them
come on let's do it one verse at a time everybody verify what it says
what does your quran say
and what does your quran say come on anybody
what does say
don't feed me propaganda tell me what says
here are translations of what is yours
we can get to that later let's stick with one issue and cover it
stop changing subjects what does your say
what does your quran's say
look at you you can't even defend a single verse of the quran that we can all verify
it tells women to stay at home right
and it tells women not to display themselves right
okay you had your chance at an honest discussion now you are blocked
do we agree that islam tells women to stay at home and not display
so when taliban make women stay home and wear burquas are they not implementing
no it is only talking to women so are the taliban and isis and saudis not implementing when they force women home
when the taliban make women wear burquas are they not preventing women from displaying themselves
no it says this
now show me the screen or photo of yours or type it
show me the verse where it says that it is forbidden to force people into doing something
this is your tweet it is not
stop making up lies show me with a verse
so now that we know that islam tells women to stay at home we can move on to the subject of forcing women to obey
and here we have it what does your say
why
what does your say same as these
but the quran says that verses can be abrogated right now let's get to compulsion later what does say
you are babbling says this
stay on until we agree what it says
no it clearly says to beat them the rest are other options beat them is there in black and white not what you say
no not going to bed with her is a seperate option there is no mentally
only two verses and we are making progress
okay so let's try one more verse what does your say
so your claim is that me are physically superior right
not talking about what you choose to do i'm talking about what islam says
beating her was not recommended but allowed
actually he hit aisha but i don't have time for that now
what does your say
you can deny it until i prove it
it doesn't require muscles to be a witness so can we assume the lack is mental or emotional
and because of beating would not be a reason in a sharia court
i've got translations that say hit and one that says scourge
who's translation are you using
we can get that much from the quran so maybe the hadiths can help us clarify
so these are hadiths that i copied from the usc muslim students hadith database look them up for yourself
why do you think all the translators use strike
not unless you can get professional translators to agree
but the five professional translators many of them muslims do know arabic for some it is their first language
even pickthall who is an englishman was a muslim convert
is in the quran not the hadith and you don't explain why translators would use strike
the translators knew arabic so they are right
the translations are on a muslim web site and they say strike
but let's go on to the hadith that refers back to
in that hadith it says the reason is that women lack intelligence
i'll give it to you again
so i decided to give you one more chance even beyond the translators
here is a screen shot of what i got
google translate used the word beat i hope that settles it
beyond the five translators here is google translate
you might like to watch this have a nice day
here is the truth about slavery
there is absolutely no reason for israel to give up an inch of land since that will get them nothing from muslims
the israelis should demand back the of the arabian peninsula that the muslims stole from them
i find that it's the people who claim others don't know anything about islam that don't know anything
rofl now there is a load of putin manufactured bullshit if i ever saw one
interesting that kurds are fighting for their own land but the islamist who support palestine oppose the kurds
minister of today's victories in achieved by the support of coalition airpower and iraqi army ha
no he was killed because of negative comments about putin
robert spencer in pj media muslim holidays in new york public schools why not
would it be irony if the name was vile naziism in the same way it's not irony when it's vile islam
there could be an antiislamophobic however and that would be you
he was killed because putin wanted him dead the rest is a blatantly obvious putin coverup
minutes of excruciating conspiracy theories by preacher who recently was handed islam award by king http
and hating islam is rational and therefore not a phobia
or i can go to the proven barbaric attitudes of muslims as an excellent reason to hate islam
and i don't walk in circles around a black meteor in mecca under the delusion that it will please god
yes i hate the religion of hate
no delusional one you look like the giant fool
old enough not to be fooled by religious frauds
good night
no they don't of the arabian peninsula belonged jews before the muslims began exterminating them give it back
there is not and never has been a country called palestine microbrain and that land has been the home of jews for years
muslims need to get off the land they stole from the jews now
in fact it was the jews that settled medina before the arabs then the muslims exterminated them
and by the way i'm not jewish or israeli if i were i would announce it proudly
what do you think you are spreading muslim bigot
liar
muslims celebrating international women's day
is it one of these children
sure that's a good excuse
that explains his dedication to islam
what along side
no they are not muslims
sorry i block cretins
another muslim blowhard the average gdp in saudi is less than the us and women r slaves
islam or else really that's what they are taught to pray those who earned anger amp those that have went astray
yeap breeding and violence are the only thing they do well
i don't have to live there to know you can't drive
i know saudis chased girls into a burning building
i know that if your husband divorces you he get's control of kids
just block me and stop crying
i doubt that a single person on the supreme court knew what sunnah or hadith meant
female slavery in saudi
and the prophet ruined their faith by raping them
yeah it's a generous sentiment but it's not true
thanks for parading your racism
hey it's what your prophet mohammed actually did not just talk about so what is your problem
showing that you are a liar since there is zero evidence
by the way i have to ask do you really consider islam to be spiritual really
show a shred of evidence for your insane assertion head chopper
the us didn't launch a proxy war on syria microbrain
lol i don't think i've ever hear a lamer rationalization in my life that kind of lying gets you blocked
you blab nonsense i provide evidence
and now you are again beaten and for being a liar again blocked
brilliant how the english spy and t israelis got erdogan to let all those terrorists into syria through turkey
stupid article devoid of facts or reason
big deal the spell checker makes it's own decisions some times you look like a twat for making it an issue
this is relevant how
ah your point being to show me you are an anti semite thanks
i know i'm fine stepping on his name amp i don't intend to fix it but thanks for the inane observations
looks to me like you are clearly the racist genocide supporter
since the slug is closer to your iq i can understand the fascination
i don't care about slavo turks or idiots that live on race baiting get lost
max blumenthal the jewish anti-semite get his comeuppance here
okay you had your chance you are are race baiting pos and gone
based on the lie of blasphemy so they could get rid of them and steal their possessions
no action against your imaginary actions imagine that
rofl
screw you i won't let you define what is and is not an allowed subject of humor according to your pc bible of protected groups
don't be an idiot nobody threatened blumenthal he does this for self promotion
of course if zionist thugs threaten attack max should have reported it to the police but i'm betting
p can you identify these zionist thugs mr blumenthal b my mother
p can you tell us what threat your mother made mr blumenthal b she said be careful
and the muslims claimed that mohammed rose to heaven at now site of al aqsa so they could take it
but the battle for poses a lot of questions about 's role http
more than millitants killed in south kirkuk operation
everybody pushes their agenda microbrain including you
what is it with the religious zealots of islam and t treatment f humanity
george will do that after he runs for mayor of peshwar where he is a shoe in to win
lol so you came up with a conspiracy theory for one and approved all the rest brain dead
so muslim anti christianity is fine by you but jewish anti christianity should be an offense
you just did birdbrain
is assad syria microbrain
so come up with a drop of oil from any nation that the us has not paid full market price for butthead
aw how awful that they got rid of humanitarians like hussain and gaddafi i feel your pain
and there would have been no iraq elections real shame
i don't think you could give me enough money to take that job
remember that yanukovich stole billion and his buddies stole another billion so moving up is easy
nuland's nazis i didn't know that the muslims were working for nuland
he did suggest that idiot
as opposed to the genocidal islamist mega donors that support blumenthal
norman finkelstein not self hating enough for past his sell by date
did you corner them in a toilet and threaten to talk them to death
the french got it exactly right you support the people that have conduced a genocide against jews for years
good send me a fee copy i'm running low on toilet paper
yeah taught him all of the islamic quran based barbarity that he put to use in syria
and it makes it hard to distinguish the feces from max's ideas but then that's no change
gee that's as bad as your muslim friends murdering christians and yezidis in iraq and syria - the horror
rofl proving that blumenthal is quite happy to invent stories to drive his racism
the islamic covering is forced by islam as part of sexist persecution
no idiot they were completely exterminated on the majority of the arabian pennisula
and the ones who were allowed to live had to live under the code of umar making them third class citizens
a he's a racist and a bigot b he wants to sell books and be famous
sorry i only accept relevant comments from people with a brain blocked
converted my ass forced to convert at sword point
here is then pact of umar that they lived by
not only is it not a fact it's a gross lie
so what asshole that doesn't change the fact that muslims did forced conversion and that they never stopped
that's a huge pile of shit the only reason they would do that is so they could force them to pay jizya
you are repeating yourself butthead it has nothing to do with forced conversion by muslims
and the massacres of jews by muslims was even greater
no shit for brains the first use of a word is not the same as the first existence of the phenomena
would soon be no one left to rob and since they were only good for killing people they would become impoverished
here is a comparison of slavery in islam as compared to the west
to suggest that jews of israel should subject their lives to the same barbarity that the copts of egypt live under is insane
you continue to rant like idiot no one suggests that we go back to old empires my point is islam has no chance to humanize
they didn't make it their islam had to be continually forced on people even the muslim clerics know
hell asshole if you have to live as a dhimmi with no rights wouldn't that make most convert
here look at this and shut your mouth until you do because there is nothing coming out
here
here
here again
here
hey asshole try reading our oriental heritage by the respected historian will durant see chapter on muslim invasion
of the indian subcontinent
she thought the color highlighted her eyes
right anti zionism is anti semitism with the addition of an excuse
but max has to pretend the two are different or he can't give full play to his bigotry and hatred
not to mention the every day race baiting that has normalized in your brain
glad you like it
so what do you think they will never have it
so does it mean he has to stay in his house and be beaten no then shut up
and absolutely ignorant
what land you left when muslim armies invaded israel and this guy says you are all egyptians amp saudi
and here is a picture of muslims celebrating women's rights
eh yeah they don't have any place to go but the tiny red strip
good
think of all the palestinian christians that have been chased away by muslim bigotry
oh palestine where art thou palestine
or how muslim women are living every day
if the palestinians had the ability to make it happen it would be the other way around
i can ask you the same question about your tweet
rofl answered by a single verse of the quran
in fact i think i'll go watch some gilmore girls on netflix goodnight
interesting do the vedas bagavad gita or upanishads say to beat your wife is ghandi a prophet of hinduism
because if non of those things are true i don't see how your statement is relevant
because the subject of individual indiscretion is independent of what the religion advocates
i don't have a religion but i'm somewhat fond of the tao te ching it wouldn't surprise me if there are bad people in tao
but you'll never be able to point to anything in the tao te ching that encouraged their misbehavior
think about it good night
well the old testament is at times gruesome but there are differences
good night
and it's not a race between bible and quran but rather between secular humanitarianism and quran
isis boko haram al queda taliban iran hanging kurds egyptians killing copts etc etc etc
hate nazism not the nazis
the idea that it is the jews who are at fault is stupid beyond believe
what do you call this
what do you call this
why waste the effort they are all becoming secularists
we only have to put up with you until we wake up to the facts about islam
yet another falsehood by max blumenthal and mondoweiss see 's
basically death for apostacy and for adultery are a part of sharia so you can say that out of
they support the death penalty for murder not for leaving christianity
but it doesn't matter what they support since we have separation of church and state
i don't care if someone believes that as long as they don't assert the right to kill me for leaving
the us implemented separation of church and state at a time when us was far more christian than today
they want their own islamic schools to prevent that kind of education
here is a good discussion of slavery
the quran
if you won't accept any evidence then why bother asking me for it
why would i care about the bible the standard is secular humanism not the bible
your islam is taquiyya
happy to hear that i don't mind admitting that i've been worried about the behavior of the shia militia
looks much to intelligent to be baghdadi
new pictures of abu bakr al-baghdadi have been released after defeats in and see picture
forces beat in reach city center to start liberation via
must watch moving clip on kurdish pol prisoners executed under rouhani's tenure in
kurdish forcec and allies cleansed qaraqawzaq bridge area from isis terrorists
i think the word you are looking for is ethnically cleansed ahmed
all the domestic violence data from muslim countries says that you are lying
so i'm going to block the rest of this group have a nice day
part of max's shtick is to play the victim of censoring people but his real problem is that his anti-semitism is a big yawn
so to liven things up we can look at max's friends at play
always love to hear people show how smart they are by talking about the inevitable after the fact
free kids with a future that makes the kobane battle all worthwhile
them who
rofl good one
so you decide if they are true or false based on if you like them or not it means you don't accept evidence bye
is questioning available in paperback yet it is
and you know it's not true because you don't like it you are calling the muslima in the video a liar bye
daesh now teetering tikrit kabisa hit shingal tal abyad jarablus baiji hawija gurma mosul the more daesh lose the less t
at this point and the way things are going baghdadi has to know he will be dead before the end of
you guys didn't put up much of a fight in tikrit the fall of the daesh is on an accelerating curve
taking tiny villages while loosing major cities like tikrit
it won't make it for nearly as long this time
even their attempted major attacks were too weak to succeed and every attack thinned them out even more
now the daesh are helpless just waiting for the end pretending to be strong in their utter weakness
so at least half the muslims are apostates
and sharia says apostates must be killed
no it's not about a load of philosophical bullshit it's about this
and this
are you actually denying that sharia says that apostates must be killed
horse shit the quran says that apostacy is not accepted multiple hadiths say apostates must be killed
disarming the shia militia comes after isis
iraq is fertilized by rotting stinking lion corpses
intelligent men kill ignorant lions like they were house flies
dtn iraq iraq vows tikrit victory but avoiding sectarian reprisals may be the real test iraqi security forc
lying scumbag
wrong to stop human lives from being taken by isis it is necessary to kill them
and it is impossible to kill isis without some collateral damage since they hide among civilians
your crying is not about caring for humanity it is simply propagandizing your agenda
kobane was the isis graveyard tikrit is much softer
are you complaining do you know how to defeat isis with no civilian or property damage
she didn't do squat to make the us a more decent place she is one more criminal that belongs in jail
the whole apartheid mantra is just a way of saying jews should subject themselves to population imperialism
and it doesn't matter what the torah says since jews have separation of church and state and live by secular laws
how do you know that the picture is not just a part of palestines planned propaganda war
and why do you ignore the fact that this resulted because of hamas rocket attacks on israel
it's like telling me to unlearn my hatred of nazis
no idiot go look up the term anti-semite how it originated and what it refers to you are beyond lame with that
i don't have a birthright campaign microbrain
in fact the palestinians don't even belong there most of them are saudis and egyptians proof
happens to them
what's funny is fucknuts like you claiming that palestinian intentions are benign when they
palestinians must go back to egypt and saudi where they came from there will be no withdrawal
and there is no palestine and never has been a palestine
i just told you idiot go look up the origin of the name anti semite and what it's meaning is
we've already established that you won't accept evidence for anything you don't like so i can't waste my time blk
i'm not saying it's not happening i'm saying let's see some real evidence before we jump to conclusions
do you suggest they drive out isis by shelling them with cotton candy
the question is if civilians are being targeted not if that are getting some colateral damage
i don't follow are you saying the same guy is in isis and leads the shia militia
isis are all sunni isis hates the shia one guy cannot be both isis and a leader of the shia militia
the only group that is behaving somewhat reasonably are the kurdish forces
haven't seen that one
according to that abc report then iraqi army may also be committing crimes
and they will be unable to pull a nation together after isis if they don't stop the sectarian killing
we are questioning max as if he were seeking truth but he is only seeking fame and money
that's an easy link
about the difference between your kids and their kids
in fact isis follows the example of the prophet to the letter
i thought that this article would give examples of how isis behavior contradicted islam there were non
this article is by a person who has likely never read a page of the quran in their lives
you have to be dumber than a rock to think that isis wants a jewish state
got some evidence for that
wrong again asshole just look at the christian vs muslim population demographic for the last years
no she's not
and you are a nazi redneck with a deep love of fascism
here is your family album
yeah keep celebrating while you look like a cretin
no comparison there was not a friendly relationship between them
probably because both are genocidal and want to rule the world through violence
here is just a part of the story
this is too easy
no i'd go piss on you because of how stupid your are
can be verified from countless sources
ahh this is a christian conspiracy book involving so few real christians that their actions are unnoticed and irrelevant
i know hundreds of christians but not a single one that fits the discription
state dept to shut down part of an email network believed to be infected by russian hackers
and let's not forget that epstein is in the mold of the american left and great friends with the clintons
there is nothing incorrect about the generalization look at minority demographics in
in any majority muslim country
and there is nothing wrong with stoping the muslim genocide of non muslims
curious which way is this punch going

as long as women have a biological advantage that sport or activity will be undervalued and ridiculed
i'm really sorry do you have a suggestion for a rephrase cissexism alert
i meant to highlight that activities in which women perform well are not deemed worthy because it is women that do them
such as crafts needlepoint sewing knitting or gymnastics where women typically outperform men
amp there r no arguments like men just can't outdo women because their bodies aren't up to the task in these activities
as long as women have a biological advantage in x sport x sport will be undervalued is what that was attached to
i did not mean disadvantage because women do have body advantages in some sports flexibility size etc

men joke about rape it's just a joke women have no sense of humor women joke about consensual sex women are too raunchy not funny
your caveat that it's not cool when men do it either is a false equivalence those statements have unequal weights
if this is the smartest thing to come out of your mouth i think your only competition is fecal vomit
women are never tired

it's hard being around people who aren't actively trying to fight their own oppressive behaviors find your people to keep you calm
hey followers i'm back from a -week vacation and ready to call people sexist again thanks for sticking around

have you ever been to any sporting event at any level in your life not sexist but lads don't tend to scream
i'm sure your mommy still does your laundry but mine can defend against a child's foolish words
it's obvious why the former president of the ncta would try to kill net neutrality but you should resign from the fcc
you should also have to disclose on the fcc's website that u have business connections to cable a huge conflict of interest
please stop comcast from merging with time warner and protect net neutrality you were a representative pre-fcc not a lobbyist
protect net neutrality comcast should not be guiding the fcc's hands with cash don't you guys have a conscience
after seeing your philosophy on regulation in general i think it is pretty disappointing that you are a leader at the fcc
slashing net neutrality won't change the marketplace how dumb do you think we are
it is unconscionable that our regulatory bodies are so transparently in bed with corporate interests and that they think we won't notice
because your target demographic is s businessmen apparently fun fact don draper fucking loves tea

men are oppressive toxic beings women are awful drivers

are going to shout over wastes of carbon material like until they are heard you are a drop in the ocean pal
retweet every last threat so the world will finally see what we live with
are sick and tired of but there's two sides to rape and murder
see fire when men make excuses for the murderer of seven innocent women
are not going to just let it go there are countless women who are killed every day in single numbers who are forgotten
because if elliot rodger had killed just one woman who had rejected him for a date it would not be national news
because i made sure i wasn't alone and had multiple witnesses before firing a male colleague
more women have died from domestic violence in the last decade than soldiers have been killed in iraq amp afghanistan
yeah we're well aware of this threat keep that in mind next time you friendzone someone
on point
were told to yell fire instead of rape because people would be more likely to respond

what charming lads i can't imagine why women wouldn't want to impress you

calling someone sexist = worse than sexism i'm glad of the daily allotment of male tears though they keep my skin fresh and dewy
men acting like mythology is static and the characters don't change drastically over generations
stories evolve and change to reflect lessons that society finds valuable i think women are human beings is a lesson that needs learning
pretty fucking sick of this pattern many women recount same experience men insist they're still right in spite of said experience
it's a unique challenge to uphold feminist ideals in a heated argument in your second language against three men
yeah unlike this tweet i'm not sexist but do girls do everything for attention
your childhood was a piece of racist and sexist shit and we set it on fire

male followers it's time to collect your trash
in men have toes on each foot i can make up statistics too
wow there's a lot of trash in my mentions this morning rape culture
the bureau of justice statistics report only analyzed reported rapes and since the vast majority of rapes are unreported cont
their report is the very definition of cherry picking
and lol to the original trash who whined about rainn statistics coming from self-report the bjs report is self-report from a survey
not to mention the bjs survey does not consider it rape when a man has sex with an unconscious intoxicated woman just like rapists
changing the definition of rape makes it easy as shit to massage the stats to make your community look better
but since most of the victims are women i guess you can't be arsed to give a shit about them
