is the biggest load of bullshit ive ever heard im sorry has to put up with this its very important that we all call out this sort of behaviour amp those of us that hold any sort of senior position make sure were there as allies for those who need it
what this woman will be told she should have done wear kevlar stay indoors or will we pretend that this was a lone wolf and therefore use the fall back nothing would surprise me anymore

right unbelievable
it's alright lads it's so we can allocate this one to lone wolf amp no need for any changes as you were
if the campaign is making you mad then you probably are that guy anyone who isnt that guy will be spreading awareness and helping to stop people being that guy we know its we know women can be violent too but that deserves its own conversation

how much do you bet that a lot of the men who cry are the same guys who call all women bitches when they have a bad relationship
this is a prime example of what you get on the hashtag so once again for the hard of understanding we know it's not all men i'm getting really sick of the women gets raped men most affected attitude from some of these guys
i am going to presume you are talking about the man's actions the problem is use a tactic called sealioning to what if their harassment target into wasting their time explaining themselves when it was never about the tech in the first place

psa to all women you have mental health problems see a therapist
this is true absolutely its but sadly its a lot of men
men read this its not about its about but some men and we see dodgy behaviours in our mates dont we we cant let it pass any more
shes young and fragile making the spell i casted on her incorrigiblebut im sorry cutie pie these are some of the benefits that come with being alpha
my response to that is 'true but ' of all violent crimes are committed by men
i wrote this pre-this twitter account but though it worth sharing again given the current climate
another blocked i won't be taking advice from men who target women to criticise them for speaking out against their own abuse no amount of or whataboutery is going to convince me that you have anything to say that's worth listening to
how fragile must ur ego be to trot out hashtag when have women said all men never but keep ur eyes open to every leer wolf-whistle checking out grabbing joking about some part of a womans bodyan endless list when u see how much there is maybe youll get it
we all know its but the fact that women dont feel safe is because of men the longer we behave with this misplaced fragility then the longer this will continue get your head from out of your arse and become part of the solution
loving the commentary on my recent post men claiming its that women rape too it was just one police officer dont forget trans amp a nice personal attack on my appearance thrown in its beautiful to see so many men rallying to support each other against my attack
woke up to trending in the uk fucking unbelievable after the revelations of the trial dudes its and it makes it terrifying up be a woman in public feeling unduly ashamed come get your people
i'm not having bacon this morning
ffs i see the hashtag is trending again poor things we know its not all men but the point is it is
in recent days im seeing that the has morphed into not all police where next not all mps this is an unhelpful narrative coming from too many in policing and often shared by many people who i follow and who follow me
hey heres some advice for you
yes we know it isnt all men but the problem is that we don't know which men every woman i know has had a sexual comment made to them or have be touched inappropriately by a man or been cat called or sexually assaulted its enough men
your job to root these idiots out lads
this start with language education fitting punishments institutions start by acknowledging there is a real f king problem that is decades old and you have all just tolerated and facilitated it
i had to go in on these ash-lords defending this predator- check it out
can't believe is trending makes as much sense as read the fucking room be an ally listen and understand call out all the bullshit you hear from all the lads that boring toxic bullshit you ignore that do that
the men once again pointing out that men are more likely to be murdered than women yes also by men thus reiterating that the problem with violence is men here's the stats again for those who couldn't be bothered to read them the first time
and here-here- is why fuck all will ever be done they don't care our safety doesn't matter
years ago this question was given to my daughter in school misogyny is institutional and its no wonder boys grow up with these attitudes
men if one of your co-workers attracts a nickname like 'the rapist' can you start doing something about it not just letting them carry on and don't fucking me you all need to do this you knew this after the yorkshire ripper case and it's still true
oh ffs was waiting for the crew how the hell are women supposed to know if you're good or bad mate when they're alone at night you all look the same so why not help us to stop the bad ones rather than bleat about how you're not to blame
almost missed news whilst tweets trend court rules undercover policing operation against protest movements were unlawful and sexist ops long ago but obvs its still possible for a rapist or murderer to join police - abuse position
i still like men im fully on team ignore those on a witch-hunt just sanctimonious feminists
thoroughly incensed by hardcore feminists speaking on my behalf i trust men and the police as much as i trust anyone else this vilification must stop
if you see a story about men raping and murdering women and your reaction is or to be offended then this directly applies to you if the shoe fits
a man walks into a bar he sees a woman being harassed by another man moved to action he marches up to them amp explains to the woman not all men are like this the woman punches them both confused the men console each other rinse amp repeat ad nauseam
the brigade are the same ones that denigrate women drivers so they don't mind starring people with the same brush as long as they aren't the target
this is whats trending
logs onto twitter sees logs off twitter
not every women i have plenty of female friends and they dont all feel like this and while im at it are predictors
is trending like it always does here we go again we know its not all men but it is all women set aside your ego and learn how to be a better ally like my friend who stayed on the phone with me tonight as i felt unsafe
are we really still having the conversation we know it's not all men but it's enough that pretty much all women have changed their behaviour at some point to protect themselves from the few
i'm also still fucking livid that people are still using the trope having lost a friend last time i shared on fb about this because she'd rather defend men than stand with other women
if your response to the sentencing of a rapist and murderer is you are part of the problem
not again
amazing how it's a tiny minority but also at least= in women bloody busy tiny group
a policeman a father a friend a date a boyfriend a stranger a colleague a husband a brother a-nother and another and another
a platinum jubilee medal to prince andrew and around and around we go
i dont give a flying fuck if its it is all women every woman has been harmed by catcalling by toxic attention or by actual physical harm of women have been raped or assaulted i dont care if your feelings are hurt because im fucking exhausted
the men have no fucking idea do they
wow things i've taken for granted all my life i know there are monsters out there more than most but this has opened my
and the award for shittiest hashtag ever goes to its obviously not all men but the fact my wife feels she has to phone me on her way home from a hair appointment at pm as she is scared tells you what you need to know any man triggered by this is part of the problem
sure it may be but it definitely and when thats the case women have to behave like it is all men to survive
too many though
f ck me does it really need saying again if you feel the need to post anytime a man gets convicted of rape then you're part of the problem stop getting defensive over the fact that most rapists are men because it is a fact be part of the solution not the problem
many people are attacking the police and saying all men hence the movement socials are awash with bitter feminists
why is it that the same people who are saying it's said also good chance that they support and deny climate change odd
if it's then need to take every small hint of disrespect towards women seriously men are a threat to women understand that
it doesnt stop it isnt ending
not all men are evil the majority are not stop this senseless vilification
i completely agree im on team and many women abuse harm kill children too
dismayed at the current outpouring of hate for police and the vilification of all men i still trust in both some people are just born bred evil and theres no cure for those individuals
as i often say but just enough to fuck it up for the rest of us
whilst commit abuse we are being defined by behaviours of some men and those behaviours we are willing to accept men will continue to be judged until we show the leadership being discussed here by
they also reinforce the unhelpful concept
delphi just makes sense here the reason we hear the narrative is because her ideas dont fit the aims of the manosphere far too many men like the male as victims narrative but not the perpetrator one strange thing is men are victims of mens violence
those without ovaries simply attack assault rape murder and make laws for those with
this must be so true tired scared angry and frustrate will be a few of the emotions that women will be feeling today focus your actions on sorting this especially men out there who continue to hide behind yes but some committing a hell of a lot of violence
we know its not but what we should be talking about is make it home safe
why cant a woman just walk home
not to worry it's they were probably nags or slags or outdoors on their own or wearing earphones the only way to change it is for males to change their behaviour at a meaningful level inconvenient and it won't happen to suggest it should makes you a bad lady
in my highschool days it was used to store condoms
i should have asked him what is trigger is
go away with your you have my sympathies for what you have suffered however if you actually put aside your defensive male pride amp engage with what she says you know damn well that as man interacting with the world you are not preyed on like this by women routinely
can't get pregnant breaking news
male is at an epidemic rate with of cases closed early without charge hardly surprising when our criminal justice system is severely underfunded amp the main perpetrators of abuse put their energy into crying what about men amp
just men not women
this is a prime example of why men should stop being shitty to women if we don't want to talk to them sometimes the creepy guys who hit on us accept no thanks but often it results in verbal or physical abuse amp that is always on our minds when we're approached
and before you me with it doesnt matter literally in my years of running no woman has ever heckled me or said something stupid to try to get my attention not one
unfortunately although fortunately it is some men have artificial support in holsters at their hip or tucked into their butt or something or even especially in texas stuffed down front of their pantsso they can grab it whenever they want just to compensate

seems more like something men would use to commit more crimes against women but yes let's bring gender to this crime not like we have been saying for more heinous ones
if it doesnt apply to you it wasnt directed towards you i dont feel the need to defend all men because im not horrible so it doesnt apply to me if you hold your self to be one of those good men then is unnecessary
